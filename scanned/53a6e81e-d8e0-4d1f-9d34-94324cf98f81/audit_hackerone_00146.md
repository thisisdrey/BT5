# [M] Download of file with arbitrary extension via injection into attachment header

## Summary
Severity: Medium (CVSS 4.7)
Program: Nextcloud
Weakness: Code Injection
Reporter: foobar7
State: resolved
Disclosed: 2021-08-11T09:15:26.776Z
CVE: CVE-2021-32679
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/1215263

## Details
Description
-----------

When downloading mail attachments, the app fails to properly escape quotes in the content disposition header. Because of this, an attacker can send a victim a file with a benign extension such as `.txt` or `.png` which when downloaded will be stored with a malicious extension such as `.bat` or `.docm`. 

This vulnerability can for example be exploited in the following scenarios:

- It allows bypassing of extension-based attachment filtering by email providers (or other intermediate email systems), as is common in many networks.
- As the attachment is displayed as a benign file in Nextcloud, a user may incorrectly trust it to be a benign file.


POC
---

- Send a mail to an email address that is connected to Nextcloud Mail with an attached file called `test.bat".png`. 
- open the mail -> click on the attachment icon -> click on the download icon. While Nextcloud correctly displays the file as a benign `.png` file, it will be downloaded as `test.bat` instead.  

Tested with Firefox under Windows.

As alternative to `.bat` files (which may be prevented from executing by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen), an attacker can also send other malicious files such as for example `.vbs` files, as well as `.docm` files containing macro viruses.
