# Q5849: calc-multiplier-delta via redeem: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, drive `calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) — which compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag — to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `redeem` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
