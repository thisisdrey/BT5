# Q1940: secp256k1 - `try_into().ok()?` swallowing a malformed key or signature (2)

## Question
Given the victim account has no entry in `self.accounts`, so `has_public_key` falls back to implicit-key derivation, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `simulate_intents(signed: Vec<MultiPayload>)` - a view call any party (including a solver's quoting path) may rely on, reach a branch of `Secp256k1RecoverableSignature` in `crates/crypto/src/secp256k1.rs` where a malformed key, point-at-infinity, or non-canonical scalar is discarded with `.ok()?` in a way that changes which arm decides the result rather than rejecting outright, breaking the invariant ``Secp256k1RecoverableSignature` returns `Some(pk)` only when a cryptographically valid signature by `pk` over the exact payload exists` and leading to direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/crypto/src/secp256k1.rs](crates/crypto/src/secp256k1.rs) - `Secp256k1RecoverableSignature` (cross-check `recover` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `simulate_intents(signed: Vec<MultiPayload>)` - a view call any party (including a solver's quoting path) may rely on
- Attacker controls: the entire simulated batch and every field of each payload
- Exploit idea: Supply values that fail conversion in one arm so control falls through to a weaker arm or to a default that still returns a public key. Set-up: the victim account has no entry in `self.accounts`, so `has_public_key` falls back to implicit-key derivation.
- Invariant to test: `Secp256k1RecoverableSignature` returns `Some(pk)` only when a cryptographically valid signature by `pk` over the exact payload exists
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation
- Fast validation: Fuzz `Secp256k1RecoverableSignature` with malformed keys/signatures; assert it never returns `Some` for an invalid pair.
