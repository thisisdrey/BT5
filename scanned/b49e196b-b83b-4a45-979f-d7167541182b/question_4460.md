# Q4460: iter-find-superset via collateral-remove: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the set of assets held reach `iter-find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it short-circuits on the first superset match, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267` -> `iter-find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the set of assets held varied, and assert that the value `iter-find-superset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
