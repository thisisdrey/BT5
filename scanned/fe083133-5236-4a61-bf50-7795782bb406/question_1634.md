# Q1634: Exchange offer lifecycle: seller inputs / stale snapshot / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline while the offer contains multiple loans whose economic state can diverge while storage stays static and make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline
- Exploit idea: make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement
- Fast validation: Simulate cancel/relist cycles and ensure no listed loan remains locked or economically bound to a dead offer.
