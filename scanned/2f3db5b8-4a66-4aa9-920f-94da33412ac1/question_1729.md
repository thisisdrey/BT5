# Q1729: Exchange offer lifecycle: relist cycle / stale snapshot / one live offer state

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled cancellation and re-listing cycles for the same loans while every listed loan is locked to the exchange while the offer is live and make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way, breaking the rule that an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan and leading to Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled cancellation and re-listing cycles for the same loans
- Exploit idea: make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way
- Invariant to test: an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer
- Fast validation: Model cashflow accrual during an active offer and assert settlement cannot mix old storage with new economic state improperly.
