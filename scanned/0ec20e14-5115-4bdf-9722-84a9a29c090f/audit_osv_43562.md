## Summary

CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2026-08-15

Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=4.20.0 <5.10.261, >=5.11.0 <5.15.212, >=5.16.0 <6.1.178, >=6.2.0 <6.6.145, >=6.7.0 <6.12.97, >=6.13.0 <6.18.40, >=6.19.0 <7.1.5

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-multipath: fix flex array size in struct nvme_ns_head

struct nvme_ns_head contains a flexible array member, current_path[],
which is indexed using the NUMA node ID:
head->current_path[numa_node_id()]

The structure is currently allocated as:
size = sizeof(struct nvme_ns_head) +
       (num_possible_nodes() * sizeof(struct nvme_ns *));
head = kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);

This allocation assumes that NUMA node IDs are sequential and densely
packed from 0 .. num_possible_nodes() - 1. While this assumption holds
on many systems, it is not always true on some architectures such as
powerpc.

On some powerpc systems, NUMA node IDs can be sparse. For example:
NUMA:
  NUMA node(s):              6
  NUMA node0 CPU(s):         80-159
  NUMA node8 CPU(s):         0-79
  NUMA node252 CPU(s):
  NUMA node253 CPU(s):
  NUMA node254 CPU(s):
  NUMA node255 CPU(s):

That is, the possible/online NUMA node IDs are: 0, 8, 252, 253, 254, 255
In this case: num_possible_nodes() = 6

So memory is allocated for only 6 entries in current_path[]. However,
the array is later indexed using the actual NUMA node ID. As a result,
accesses such as:
head->current_path[8] or
head->current_path[252]
goes out of bounds, leading to the following KASAN splat:

The buggy address belongs to the object at c00020003bda3000

The buggy address is located 16 bytes to the right of

 c00020003bda3680: fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc
==================================================================

Fix this by allocating the flexible array using nr_node_ids instead
of num_possible_nodes(). Since nr_node_ids represents the maximum
possible NUMA node IDs, indexing current_path[] using numa_node_id()
becomes safe even on systems with sparse node IDs.
