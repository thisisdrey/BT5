# Q1701: remove-user-scaled-debt via borrow: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, drive `remove-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244) — which deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244` -> `remove-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-scaled-debt` deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set. Reach it through `borrow` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `remove-user-scaled-debt` touches, run `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
