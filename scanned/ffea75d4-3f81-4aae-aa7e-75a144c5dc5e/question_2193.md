# Q2193: resolve-callcode via call-ststx-ratio: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, drive `resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) — which chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx` — to convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction, breaking the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-callcode` touches, run `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
