# Q4582: calc-cumulative-debt via redeem: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `amount` of shares burned, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index, so the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `redeem` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with `amount` of shares burned, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
