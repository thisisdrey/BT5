# Q2232: interpolate-rate via liquidate-redeem: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the redemption receiver reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the redemption receiver across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `interpolate-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
