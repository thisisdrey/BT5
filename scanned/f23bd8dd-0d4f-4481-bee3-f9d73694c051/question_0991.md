# Q0991: lib - no-sign or extension path reachable without authorisation

## Question
Given the wallet's nonce bitmap has just rotated `current` into `old`, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `w_execute_signed(msg: RequestMessage, proof: String)` - relayable by any account, reach `send_sign_request` in `crates/mpc/signer/src/lib.rs` through the `no-sign` signature schema or the extension path so a `Request` executes without any signature check, breaking the invariant `every executed `NearAction` == one the owner signed, or one an owner-enabled extension requested` and leading to direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/mpc/signer/src/lib.rs](crates/mpc/signer/src/lib.rs) - `send_sign_request` (cross-check `MPC_SIGN_GAS` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `w_execute_signed(msg: RequestMessage, proof: String)` - relayable by any account
- Attacker controls: the entire `RequestMessage` (chain_id, signer_id, nonce, deadline, ops) and the `proof` string
- Exploit idea: `w_execute_extension` trusts `env::predecessor_account_id()` against the enabled-extension set; probe extension enable/disable ordering and the zero-deposit requirement. Set-up: the wallet's nonce bitmap has just rotated `current` into `old`.
- Invariant to test: every executed `NearAction` == one the owner signed, or one an owner-enabled extension requested
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation
- Fast validation: Call `w_execute_extension` from a non-enabled predecessor and with zero deposit; assert rejection.
