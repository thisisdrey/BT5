# [H] Git for Windows: Server-advertised bundle-uri can trigger outbound SMB callbacks via UNC and file:// paths on Windows

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-62960
Aliases: GHSA-xrpg-8j9v-v282
CVSS: 7.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Type: osv

## Details
Git for Windows is the Windows port of Git. Prior to 2.55.0.windows.4, a malicious remote Git server can advertise a bundle URI that reaches transport_get_remote_bundle_uri(), fetch_bundle_uri_internal(), and copy_uri_to_file() in bundle-uri.c during clone or fetch when transfer.bundleuri=true. Non-HTTP(S) values are treated as local filesystem paths, and file URI prefixes are removed, so a bare UNC path or file URI targeting an attacker-controlled share causes Windows to initiate an outbound SMB connection. This can expose NTLM authentication material to the attacker-selected host. This issue is fixed in version 2.55.0.windows.4.
