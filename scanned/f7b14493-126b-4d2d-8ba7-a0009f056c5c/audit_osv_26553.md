# [M] nilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2023-53337
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 5.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2025-09-17
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2023-53337
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=3.10.0 <4.14.315, >=4.15.0 <4.19.283, >=4.20.0 <5.4.243, >=5.5.0 <5.10.180, >=5.11.0 <5.15.111, >=5.16.0 <6.1.28, >=6.2.0 <6.2.15, >=6.3.0 <6.3.2

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only

According to syzbot's report, mark_buffer_dirty() called from
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() outputs a warning with some patterns after
nilfs2 detects metadata corruption and degrades to read-only mode.

After such read-only degeneration, page cache data may be cleared through
nilfs_clear_dirty_page() which may also clear the uptodate flag for their
buffer heads.  However, even after the degeneration, log writes are still
performed by unmount processing etc., which causes mark_buffer_dirty() to
be called for buffer heads without the "uptodate" flag and causes the
warning.

Since any writes should not be done to a read-only file system in the
first place, this fixes the warning in mark_buffer_dirty() by letting
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() abort early if in read-only mode.

This also changes the retry check of nilfs_segctor_write_out() to avoid
unnecessary log write retries if it detects -EROFS that
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() returned.
