# Q5177: get-bitmap via liquidate: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `collateral-receiver`, drive `get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) — which returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on — to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `liquidate` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `collateral-receiver`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
