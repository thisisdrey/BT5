# Q0609: debt-add-scaled via liquidate-multi: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) — which stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller — to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, breaking the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `debt-add-scaled` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
