## Details
Function getSharesByMintedRsTAO() has been used to calculate amount of shares that corresponds to the RsTAO amount and it's been used in multiple functions like _transfer() and _mintRsTAO(). The issue is that the function getSharesByMintedRsTAO() returns 0 when the total minted amount is 0 while it should have returned the amount itself. This has multiple impacts like transferring unlimited tokens while the total mint is 0, this is the POC:
1. Suppose RivusTAO is recently deployed or for other reasons (upgrade or ...) the total amount is zero.
2. Now attacker can transfer unlimited tokens to 3rd party contracts like DEX or lending platforms and credit tokens for himself.
3. This is possible because when RivusTAO wants to transfer tokens in the _transfer() it would call getSharesByMintedRsTAO() to calculate the share amount and the share amount would be 0, so the code would have no problem transferring 0 shares.
4. In the end the 3rd party contract would charge the user account while in reality, it didn't receive any tokens. The transferFrom() call would return true and won't revert.
There are other impacts. Function _mintRsTAO() uses getSharesByMintedRsTAO() too and when the return amount is 0 then the code uses amount to mint shares. The issue is that the return amount of getSharesByMintedRsTAO() can be 0 because of the rounding error (small values of amount) and the code should have minted 0 shares while it would mint >0 shares. This can be used to extract value from contracts with small deposit amounts while the share price is high. This issue exists for rsCOMAI and RivusCOMAI contracts too.

## Recommendation
When the total minted tokens are 0 then the code should return amount in getSharesByMintedRsTAO(). The function getMintedRsTAOByShares() should be fixed too. Those fixes should be applied to COMAI contracts too.
