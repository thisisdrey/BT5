# Q5758: oracle-last-update via collateral-remove-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
