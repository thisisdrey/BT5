# Q5618: resolve-callcode via collateral-remove: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) varied, and assert that the value `resolve-callcode` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
