# Q1592: collateral-remove via repay: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) reach `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `repay` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) varied, and assert that the value `collateral-remove` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
