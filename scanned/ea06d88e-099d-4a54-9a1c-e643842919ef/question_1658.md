# Q1658: Exchange offer lifecycle: seller inputs / misbound whitelist / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline while one side is a vault or later counterparty that relies on precise lock cleanup and delivery semantics and make the mutual-registration checks bind the wrong effective buyer or seller at settlement time, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline
- Exploit idea: make the mutual-registration checks bind the wrong effective buyer or seller at settlement time
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer
- Fast validation: Forge test directed offers with multiple loans, expiry edges, and registration churn, then assert full delivery or full revert.
