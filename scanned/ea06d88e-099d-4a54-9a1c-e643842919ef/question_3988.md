# Q3988: Smart account deployment and initialization: nonce race / init replay / ownership binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with deployment timing around the deployer-specific nonce and predicted address observation while a second configuration attempt is made against a Safe that already ran initialization once and make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe, breaking the rule that deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold and leading to Theft or redirection of value sent to a predicted or freshly deployed smart account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: deployment timing around the deployer-specific nonce and predicted address observation
- Exploit idea: make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe
- Invariant to test: deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or redirection of value sent to a predicted or freshly deployed smart account
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated delegatecall attempts into `configureSmartAccount` and assert the one-shot guard holds in every reachable context.
