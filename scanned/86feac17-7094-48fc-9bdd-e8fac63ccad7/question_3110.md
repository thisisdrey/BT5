# Q3110: Address-book role bit isolation: mutual whitelist / book bleed / book isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits while the same grantee address is intentionally present under multiple roles for legitimate reasons and make self-book updates affect canonical-book semantics or another address owner's semantics, breaking the rule that a self-managed address book should never satisfy canonical-book checks or another owner's checks and leading to Loans NFT or cashflow rights entering an unauthorized counterparty context?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits
- Exploit idea: make self-book updates affect canonical-book semantics or another address owner's semantics
- Invariant to test: a self-managed address book should never satisfy canonical-book checks or another owner's checks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT or cashflow rights entering an unauthorized counterparty context
- Fast validation: Fuzz register/unregister churn across roles and ensure no stale authorization survives in create or exchange flows.
