# Q1920: Exchange offer lifecycle: cashflow timing / bundle inconsistency / exact counterparties

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active while one side is a vault or later counterparty that relies on precise lock cleanup and delivery semantics and make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert, breaking the rule that mutual investor-registration checks should bind the exact buyer and seller that receive settlement value and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active
- Exploit idea: make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert
- Invariant to test: mutual investor-registration checks should bind the exact buyer and seller that receive settlement value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement
- Fast validation: Simulate cancel/relist cycles and ensure no listed loan remains locked or economically bound to a dead offer.
