# Q2504: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via transfer: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury reach `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt, the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `transfer` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury varied, and assert that the value `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
