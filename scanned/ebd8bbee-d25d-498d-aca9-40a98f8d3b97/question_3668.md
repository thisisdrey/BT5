# Q3668: debt-add-scaled via collateral-remove: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller, the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `debt-add-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
