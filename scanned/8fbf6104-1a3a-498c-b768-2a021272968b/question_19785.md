# Q19785: Context Rebinding Slip in gas_unit_price

## Question
Can attacker-controlled inputs reaching `aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/transaction_metadata.rs::gas_unit_price` cause the runtime to rebuild or cache context in a way that differs from the context that was originally validated, enabling forged semantics or unauthorized progress?

## Target
- File/function: aptos-move/aptos-vm/src/transaction_metadata.rs::gas_unit_price
- Entrypoint: Submit a transaction, view call, or package publish that reaches `gas_unit_price` during runtime execution.
- Attacker controls: transaction payloads, module bytes, view arguments, resource values, gas fields, and attacker-chosen state transitions
- Exploit idea: Exploit a context-reconstruction gap between validation, execution, and commit paths.
- Invariant to test: Any cached or reconstructed context must be identical to the one that safety checks originally approved.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Acceptance of forged, stale, malformed, differently encoded, insufficiently bound, or context-confused bytecode, signatures, keyless proofs, JWK material, module metadata, write sets, or state proofs that bypass mainnet execution or verification rules.
- Fast validation: Force context rebuilds or cache hits in tests and assert the resulting semantics remain identical to the originally validated path.
