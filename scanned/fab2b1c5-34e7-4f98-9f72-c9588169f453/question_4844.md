# Q4844: get-liquidation-position via supply-collateral-add: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to reach `get-liquidation-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473` -> `get-liquidation-position`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to varied, and assert that the value `get-liquidation-position` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
