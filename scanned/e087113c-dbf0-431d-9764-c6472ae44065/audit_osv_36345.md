## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: cpsw: Execute ndo_set_rx_mode callback in a work queue

Commit 1767bb2d47b7 ("ipv6: mcast: Don't hold RTNL for
IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP and MCAST_JOIN_GROUP.") removed the RTNL lock for
IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP and MCAST_JOIN_GROUP operations. However, this
change triggered the following call trace on my BeagleBone Black board:
  WARNING: net/8021q/vlan_core.c:236 at vlan_for_each+0x120/0x124, CPU#0: rpcbind/481
  RTNL: assertion failed at net/8021q/vlan_core.c (236)

This trace occurs because vlan_for_each() is called within
cpsw_ndo_set_rx_mode(), which expects the RTNL lock to be held.
Since modifying vlan_for_each() to operate without the RTNL lock is not
straightforward, and because ndo_set_rx_mode() is invoked both with and
without the RTNL lock across different code paths, simply adding
rtnl_lock() in cpsw_ndo_set_rx_mode() is not a viable solution.

To resolve this issue, we opt to execute the actual processing within
a work queue, following the approach used by the icssg-prueth driver.

Please note: To reproduce this issue, I manually reverted the changes to
am335x-bone-common.dtsi from commit c477358e66a3 ("ARM: dts: am335x-bone:
switch to new cpsw switch drv") in order to revert to the legacy cpsw
driver.
