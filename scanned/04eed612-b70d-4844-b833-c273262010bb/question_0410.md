# Q0410: IsCA / chain-depth confusion in readOptionalASN1Boolean

## Question
Can an attacker use the Curve field so `readOptionalASN1Boolean` (cert/asn1.go) treats a leaf certificate as a signing CA, or accepts a chain deeper or looped beyond what is intended?

## Target
- File/function: `cert/asn1.go` -> `readOptionalASN1Boolean` (declared at cert/asn1.go:10)
- Entrypoint: Attacker-supplied certificate bytes carried in a handshake payload and passed to CA-pool verification
- Attacker controls: the Curve field; the attacker holds no CA-signed certificate, no host or root access, no leaked keys, and no configuration control.
- Exploit idea: Present a leaf marked or interpretable as a CA and attempt to have it validate a further certificate.
- Invariant to test: Only certificates explicitly marked IsCA and present in the trusted pool can validate others; chains are depth-bounded and loop-free.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Full trust bypass: the attacker becomes an issuer and mints arbitrary identities.
- Fast validation: Unit test attempting chain validation through a leaf via `readOptionalASN1Boolean` and asserting rejection.
