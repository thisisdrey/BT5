# Q3089: merge-price via collateral-add: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) — which attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id — to make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist, breaking the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
