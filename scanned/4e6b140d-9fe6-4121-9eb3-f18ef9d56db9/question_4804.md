# Q4804: interest-rate via repay: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `repay` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
