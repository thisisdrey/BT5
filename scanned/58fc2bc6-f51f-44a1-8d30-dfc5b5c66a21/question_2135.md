# Q2135: receive-underlying via supply-collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) pulls the underlying from a named account. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
