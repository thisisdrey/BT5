## Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                          
  Flowise on current `main` allows an authenticated user with
  `documentStores:preview-process` permission to trigger the `S3 Directory`                                                                                                                                    
  document loader with attacker-controlled S3 object keys. The loader joins
  each returned S3 key with a temporary directory using `path.join(tempDir, key)`                                                                                                                              
  and writes the object bytes to disk **without validating traversal sequences
  such as `../`**. Cleanup later removes only the original temporary directory,
  so files written outside that directory persist on the host filesystem.                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  This yields **arbitrary file write** with the privileges of the Flowise

  Recommended fix:                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  1. Replace `path.join(tempDir, key)` with a resolve-and-verify flow                                                                                                                                          
  2. Reject any resolved path outside `tempDir`                                                                                                                                                                
  3. Prefer a sanitized basename if directory structure is not required
  4. Apply the same fix to the `S3File` loader (`fileProcessingMethod = unstructured` branch)
