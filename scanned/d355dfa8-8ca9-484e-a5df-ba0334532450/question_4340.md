# Q4340: preparation cost vs deploy fee — profile.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `DeployContract` action carrying attacker-authored WASM, a maximal-size module engineered to maximise validation and instrumentation time per byte, with a module one structural unit past a preparation limit, and additionally with deeply nested loops and a maximal br_table target list, reach `add_action_cost` in `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/profile.rs` and make deployment cost far less gas than the CPU time every node must spend preparing it, breaking the invariant that deploy fees bound preparation cost for any accepted module, leading to High - Temporary freezing of network transactions (chunk/block production delayed 500%+ over recent average)?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/profile.rs` :: `add_action_cost`
- Entrypoint: a `DeployContract` action carrying attacker-authored WASM
- Attacker controls: a maximal-size module engineered to maximise validation and instrumentation time per byte; with a module one structural unit past a preparation limit; with deeply nested loops and a maximal br_table target list
- Exploit idea: make deployment cost far less gas than the CPU time every node must spend preparing it
- Invariant to test: deploy fees bound preparation cost for any accepted module
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of network transactions (chunk/block production delayed 500%+ over recent average)
- Fast validation: estimator measuring preparation wall time per byte for the worst-case module
