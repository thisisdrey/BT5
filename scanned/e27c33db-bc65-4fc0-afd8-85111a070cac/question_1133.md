# Q1133: Investor withdrawal routing: lock churn / stuck route / per-loan recipient

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set while a sale offer was recently accepted or cancelled before the batch executes and make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary, breaking the rule that every loan in investorWithdraw should pay only the recipient implied by that same loan's current owner and lock state and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set
- Exploit idea: make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary
- Invariant to test: every loan in investorWithdraw should pay only the recipient implied by that same loan's current owner and lock state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale
- Fast validation: Model sale-offer settlement or cancellation around `investorWithdraw` and assert no stale unlocker or stale owner can claim old payables.
