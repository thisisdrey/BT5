# Q1104: Investor withdrawal routing: lock churn / stuck route / no stale unlocker

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set while the first loan in the batch is unlocked and fixes the recipient as the current investor and make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary, breaking the rule that a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch and leading to Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set
- Exploit idea: make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary
- Invariant to test: a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows
- Fast validation: Forge test mixed locked/unlocked batches, duplicate ids, and ownership transfers, then assert each loan pays exactly one valid recipient once.
