# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description
The vulnerability is a form of directory traversal that can be exploited by extracting files from an archive. The premise of the directory traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client (user) machines and servers.

The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g.  ../../evil.sh). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including tar, jar, war,  cpio, apk, rar and 7z.
