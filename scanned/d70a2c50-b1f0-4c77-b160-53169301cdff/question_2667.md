# Q2667: process_verify_proof accepts input it should reject (lib.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `process_verify_proof` in `programs/zk-elgamal-proof/src/lib.rs` with input that makes the check pass on a value it later stops using, and have `process_verify_proof` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`process_verify_proof` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `programs/zk-elgamal-proof/src/lib.rs` -> `process_verify_proof()` (around line 36)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: input that makes the check pass on a value it later stops using
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `process_verify_proof` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `process_verify_proof` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `process_verify_proof` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
