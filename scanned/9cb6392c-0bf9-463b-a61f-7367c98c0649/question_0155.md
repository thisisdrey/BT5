# Q0155: Loans create authorization: role overlap / role confusion / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with the same attacker-controlled address reused across multiple loan roles while the attacker has only self-registered role bits in its own address book and no canonical approvals and reuse one role approval context to satisfy a different role check and initialize a loan with unauthorized parties, breaking the rule that borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only and leading to Accounting issue in Loans caused by unauthorized lifecycle initialization?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: the same attacker-controlled address reused across multiple loan roles
- Exploit idea: reuse one role approval context to satisfy a different role check and initialize a loan with unauthorized parties
- Invariant to test: borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans caused by unauthorized lifecycle initialization
- Fast validation: Check that no combination of overlapping role addresses or registration churn lets `create` mint a usable loan NFT without canonical approval.
