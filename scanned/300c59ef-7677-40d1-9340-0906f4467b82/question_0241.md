# Q0241: Loans create authorization: contract receiver / unauthorized create / canonical gate

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with an attacker-controlled contract as the proposed investor plus separate EOAs for the other roles while a victim investor or vault could later interact with the created loan through funding, withdrawal, or pricing flows and make `create` accept a caller that is neither the approved originator nor an admin/guardian, breaking the rule that only the canonical `address(this)` originator book should authorize loan creation and leading to Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: an attacker-controlled contract as the proposed investor plus separate EOAs for the other roles
- Exploit idea: make `create` accept a caller that is neither the approved originator nor an admin/guardian
- Invariant to test: only the canonical `address(this)` originator book should authorize loan creation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user
- Fast validation: Forge test a caller with only self-book registrations and assert `create` cannot succeed unless the canonical originator book explicitly approves the caller.
