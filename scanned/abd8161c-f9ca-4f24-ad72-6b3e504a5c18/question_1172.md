# Q1172: sync_indexer_flags: freeze semantics can be bypassed through an alternate user flow [an-account-just-before-and] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker bypass the intended freeze semantics by invoking `sync_indexer_flags` with an account just before and after bankruptcy-like disablement conditions so `sync_indexer_flags` still changes a blocked account, violating `synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly` and causing `Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `sync_indexer_flags`
- Entrypoint: `sync_indexer_flags`
- Attacker controls: an account just before and after bankruptcy-like disablement conditions
- Exploit idea: Audit alternate user flows that eventually touch the same balances but may not call the common frozen-account guard. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact
- Fast validation: Freeze the account, exercise alternate paths, and assert every value-moving route rejects before any state mutation occurs. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
