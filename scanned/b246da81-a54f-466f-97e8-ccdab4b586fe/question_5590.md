# Q5590: vault-accrue via liquidate-multi: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
