## Details
Hi Gitlab Security,

I notice the bug #301432 that Jobert reported earlier is could be bypassed by setting variable in environment.

The reason is that the fix in place preventing url normalization is performed by doing the YAML  validation, however this could be bypassed by setting the environment variable in `https://gitlab.com/{project_id}/settings/ci_cd`

By setting the key ONE and variable value to `../1/key`, it is possible to replicate what jobert did in #301432.

And in `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```
a:
  script:
  - echo "script"
  - echo "a"
  cache:
    key: "$ONE"
    policy: pull #or push if you like to poison
    paths:
      - .
```

Then make any change to `.gitlab-ci.yml` will trigger the bug once again.

## Impact

Quoting from  #301432
```
Depending on the files that are cached, this may allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's Docker instance running a CI run. This may expose confidential data, inject artifacts in a build pipeline to ship additional code, among other things.
```
