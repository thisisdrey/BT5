# Q1374: iter-lookup-collateral via borrow: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `borrow` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `iter-lookup-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
