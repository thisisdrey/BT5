# Q0533: Loans funding and disbursement state: role handoff / double-fund path / single funding

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call while status-like fields or off-chain expectations changed nearby but the economic balances still define the real state and make commitment or `alreadyFunded` checks observe an inconsistent ledger state that allows replayed funding or funding after the economic state advanced, breaking the rule that `fund` should only succeed once per loan and only for the current NFT owner of that same loan and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call
- Exploit idea: make commitment or `alreadyFunded` checks observe an inconsistent ledger state that allows replayed funding or funding after the economic state advanced
- Invariant to test: `fund` should only succeed once per loan and only for the current NFT owner of that same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement
- Fast validation: Model a create-transfer-fund-disburse sequence and assert stale ownership or stale lock state never authorizes a later epoch.
