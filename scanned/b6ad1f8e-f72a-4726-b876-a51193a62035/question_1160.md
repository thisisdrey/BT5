# Q1160: Investor withdrawal routing: mixed balances / double claim / no stale unlocker

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value while the first loan in the batch is unlocked and fixes the recipient as the current investor and make one payable balance claimable in two ownership or lock epochs, breaking the rule that a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value
- Exploit idea: make one payable balance claimable in two ownership or lock epochs
- Invariant to test: a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale
- Fast validation: Model sale-offer settlement or cancellation around `investorWithdraw` and assert no stale unlocker or stale owner can claim old payables.
