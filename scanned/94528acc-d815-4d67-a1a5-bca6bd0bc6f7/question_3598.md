# Q3598: debt-add-scaled via supply-collateral-add: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller, so the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
