# Q4438: accrue-debt-asset via redeem: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `min-out`, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result, so the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `redeem` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with `min-out`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
