# Q2502: iter-find-superset via collateral-remove: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match, so the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267` -> `iter-find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `iter-find-superset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
