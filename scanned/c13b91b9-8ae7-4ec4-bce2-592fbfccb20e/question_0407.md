# Q0407: remove-user-collateral via repay: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `repay` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `ft` trait principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
