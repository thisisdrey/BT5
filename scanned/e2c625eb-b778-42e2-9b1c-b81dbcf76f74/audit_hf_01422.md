# [M] M-4 Centralization Risks

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Contest weight: 0.1838
Dataset id: 7350
Source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zaevlad/audit-findings-dataset
Type: audit-finding

## Details
The issue was identified within the contract's ownership and role management structure, presenting several centralization risks:
1. Owners have the capability to upgrade the contract implementation.
2. The PAUSER_ROLE can pause all transfers of sUSX, including mints and burns, effectively halting withdrawal activities.
3. The BRIDGER_ROLE is capable of minting and burning new tokens, necessitating that this role be exclusively assigned to verified and audited contracts.
4. Owners are responsible for setting the interest rate configurations to ensure that the incoming rewards are collateralized by the treasury assets.
5. Owners must set valid mintCap values to ensure that rewards do not exceed these caps and that the caps are less than the collateral in the treasury.
6. Owners are responsible for synchronizing the exchangeRate across different chains to prevent arbitrage activities.
These centralization risks highlight the significant control owners have over the system's critical functions, which could be exploited if not managed properly. The issue is classified as medium severity due to the potential for abuse of power, which can impact the system's integrity and users' trust.

## Recommendation
We recommend implementing the following measures to mitigate centralization risks:
1. Ensure the owner is a multisig account to distribute control among multiple parties.
2. Assign the BRIDGER_ROLE exclusively to verified and audited contracts.
3. Establish valid configurations and procedures to guarantee the collateralization of rewards.
4. Ensure prompt actions can be taken to prevent rate desynchronization and potential arbitrage opportunities.
