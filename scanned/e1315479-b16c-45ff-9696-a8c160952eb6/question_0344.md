# Q344: change_asset_shares: same-bank aliasing across mutable balance updates [a-user-with-multiple-active] [cycle]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `lending_account_withdraw` with a user with multiple active balances where one is reopened in the same transaction so that `change_asset_shares` mutates the same logical bank exposure through aliased or reused balance state, violating `asset-share reductions must exactly match released value and cannot free more liquidity than the user economically owns` and causing `Critical: direct theft or unauthorized withdrawal of protocol/user funds`? Focus specifically on whether the attacker can repeat the same path in a short deterministic cycle to compound a one-step drift.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/bank.rs` / `change_asset_shares`
- Entrypoint: `lending_account_withdraw`
- Attacker controls: a user with multiple active balances where one is reopened in the same transaction
- Exploit idea: Try to make a single user action touch one economic exposure twice through reused balance slots, duplicate remaining accounts, or stale active-balance bookkeeping. Focus specifically on whether the attacker can repeat the same path in a short deterministic cycle to compound a one-step drift.
- Invariant to test: asset-share reductions must exactly match released value and cannot free more liquidity than the user economically owns
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: direct theft or unauthorized withdrawal of protocol/user funds
- Fast validation: Craft a test that reuses the same bank/account relationship in the controlled way and compare pre/post totals, shares, and user equity for double application. Run the target path in a short deposit/withdraw or borrow/repay style loop and assert no monotonic gain appears.
