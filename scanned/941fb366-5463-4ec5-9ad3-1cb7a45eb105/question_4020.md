# Q4020: accrue-collateral-asset via repay: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `repay` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `accrue-collateral-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
