# Q5956: next-liquidity-index via liquidate: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) in a state where it compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? Given that it rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval, the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `liquidate` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
