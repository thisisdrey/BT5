# Q0556: next-index via collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position's existing collateral and debt composition reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
