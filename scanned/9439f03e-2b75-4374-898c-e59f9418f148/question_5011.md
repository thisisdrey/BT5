# Q5011: system-borrow via liquidate: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865) independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865` -> `system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `system-borrow` independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow. Reach it through `liquidate` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `system-borrow` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
