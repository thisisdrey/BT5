# Q1789: linear-interpolate via supply-collateral-add: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, drive `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) — which interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)` — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, then read `linear-interpolate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
