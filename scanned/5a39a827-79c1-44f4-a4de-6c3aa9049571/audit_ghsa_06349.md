## Details
## Summary

`rclone serve restic --private-repos` exists to let one rclone instance host many users' restic backup repositories behind HTTP Basic auth while keeping each user confined to a path prefix of `/<username>/`. The documentation states the flag "can be used to limit users to repositories starting with a path of `/<username>/`", and the shipped test `TestResticPrivateRepositories` asserts that user `test` may reach `/test/config` but is `403`-blocked from `/other_user/config`. This isolation is the entire security purpose of the flag.

The isolation is enforced by two independent chi middlewares that derive the username and the backend object path from two *different* sources, and the path source is never canonicalized. `checkPrivate` authorizes the request by comparing the routed `{userID}` path segment against the authenticated user, while `WithRemote` builds the backend object key from the raw, un-cleaned URL path. A request such as `GET /<me>/../<victim>/config` keeps the first path segment equal to the attacker's own username (so `checkPrivate` returns the request as authorized) yet hands the backend the literal remote `me/../victim/config`. On any backend that resolves object paths with POSIX `path.Join`/`path.Clean` semantics — which includes the bundled `memory` backend used in the PoC below, and the widely deployed `sftp` and `ftp` backends — that `..` segment collapses, and the operation is performed against the victim's object.

Because the same un-cleaned remote feeds the `GET` (download), `POST` (upload/overwrite) and `DELETE` handlers, any authenticated user can read, overwrite, and delete the files of any other user's private repository hosted on the same server. For restic that means reading another tenant's `config`/`keys` metadata and pack files, corrupting their repository, or deleting their backups outright (subject to `--append-only`, which still permits cross-tenant reads).

## Affected code (v1.74.3, commit `37e4117…`)

`cmd/serve/restic/restic.go`. The two middlewares disagree on what "the path" is. `checkPrivate` reads the chi route param `userID`:

```go
// Middleware to ensure authenticated user is accessing their own private folder
func checkPrivate(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		user := chi.URLParam(r, "userID")
		userID, ok := libhttp.CtxGetUser(r.Context())
		if ok && user != "" && user == userID {
			next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
		} else {
			http.Error(w, http.StatusText(http.StatusForbidden), http.StatusForbidden)
		}
	})
}
```

`WithRemote` builds the backend object key from the raw URL path with **no `path.Clean`** and no `..` rejection (the only transformation is the unrelated `data/xx` sharding rewrite):

```go
func WithRemote(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		var urlpath string
		rctx := chi.RouteContext(r.Context())
		if rctx != nil && rctx.RoutePath != "" {
			urlpath = rctx.RoutePath
		} else {
			urlpath = r.URL.Path
		}
		urlpath = strings.Trim(urlpath, "/")
		parts := matchData.FindStringSubmatch(urlpath)
		// ... data/2159dd48 -> data/21/2159dd48 sharding only ...
		ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), ContextRemoteKey, urlpath)
		next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
	})
}
```

Route wiring (`Bind`): the auth-bearing `{userID}` segment is matched by chi for `checkPrivate`, but the catch-all `/*` that `WithRemote` reads keeps the literal `..`:

```go
if s.opt.PrivateRepos {
	router.Route("/{userID}", func(r chi.Router) {
		r.Use(checkPrivate)
		s.bind(r)
	})
	...
}
```

The remote stored by `WithRemote` is then used verbatim by the object handlers, e.g. `serveObject` → `s.newObject(ctx, remote)` → `s.f.NewObject(ctx, remote)`, `postObject` → `operations.RcatSize(..., remote, ...)`, and `deleteObject` → `o.Remove(...)`. For a request `GET /test/../victim/config`, instrumentation shows `checkPrivate` observing `userIDparam="test"` (authorized) while the object remote is `"test/../victim/config"` — the desync is exact.

## Attacker model / precondition

The attacker is a low-privileged but **legitimately authenticated** user of the server: they hold valid HTTP Basic credentials for their own private repo (this is the normal multi-tenant deployment the flag is designed for — e.g. a hosting provider giving each customer a restic endpoint). No victim interaction is required.

Preconditions: (1) the operator runs `rclone serve restic` with `--private-repos` and authentication configured (the documented multi-tenant setup); and (2) the served backend resolves object paths with POSIX `path.Join`/`path.Clean` semantics so the `..` collapses before the object is located. This holds for the bundled `memory` backend (used in the self-contained PoC), and for the commonly deployed `sftp` and `ftp` backends, whose object path is computed as `path.Join(f.absRoot, remote)` (`backend/sftp/sftp.go`, `o.path()`), which canonicalizes `..`. It does **not** hold for the `local` backend (which deliberately re-encodes `.`/`..` path components to fullwidth characters in `cleanRootPath`/`localPath`, neutralizing traversal), and S3-style backends treat keys as opaque so a literal `..` key normally will not match a victim object — so impact is backend-dependent. That backend-dependence is itself the defect: the cross-user authorization boundary must be enforced at the HTTP layer and must not silently rely on a particular backend's incidental path handling.

## Impact

Across the per-user trust boundary that `--private-repos` is meant to enforce, any authenticated user can, against any other user's repository on the same server:

- **Read** (`GET`): download the victim's restic `config` and `keys/*` files and pack/index objects — full confidentiality break of the victim's repository metadata and stored blobs. (Restic encrypts pack contents client-side, but the repository config, key files, snapshot/index structure and object existence all leak, and the master key is recoverable offline by anyone who also knows the victim's restic password — i.e. this removes the server-side isolation that was the only barrier.)
- **Overwrite** (`POST`): replace the victim's objects with attacker-chosen content, corrupting or poisoning their backups. Blocked only if `--append-only` is set.
- **Delete** (`DELETE`): remove the victim's repository objects, destroying their backups. Blocked only if `--append-only` is set (which still allows the read primitive).

This is a complete bypass of the multi-tenant isolation control, hence C:H/I:H/A:H, gated to PR:L by the need for a valid own-account.

## Proof of Concept (complete — runs on 127.0.0.1 only)

Lab-only. This is a single self-contained Go test placed inside the rclone source tree; it starts an in-process restic server on a loopback `httptest` listener backed by the bundled in-memory backend (which has the same `path.Join` key semantics as the sftp/ftp backends), then sends **raw**, un-normalized HTTP request-targets over a TCP socket (so the `..` is not collapsed client-side). It proves: (1) a user reads their own object — `200`; (2) a direct cross-tenant request is correctly blocked — `403`; (3) the `..` bypass reads the victim's secret — `200` + leak; (4) the same bypass overwrites the victim's object — `200`.

```

The shipped `TestResticPrivateRepositories` continues to pass alongside this PoC, confirming the intended isolation model (own `200`, direct cross-tenant `403`) is exactly what the `..` request defeats. Note the bypass is delivered as a raw request-target over the socket; a stock browser or `net/http` client would canonicalize the `..` before sending, but `curl --path-as-is`, restic's own REST client, or any raw socket write preserves it.

## Remediation

Enforce the per-user boundary on a canonicalized path, and make the authorized segment and the backend remote derive from the *same* cleaned value:

- In `WithRemote` (or before `checkPrivate` runs), reject or `path.Clean` the request path and refuse any path containing a `..` element after a leading-slash trim — e.g. compute `cleaned := path.Clean("/" + strings.Trim(urlpath, "/"))` and `403`/`400` if `cleaned` differs from the original or still contains a `..` segment. Then store `cleaned` (minus the leading slash) as the remote so the object key and the authorization decision are computed from one source of truth.
- Additionally, in `checkPrivate`, verify that the (cleaned) object remote actually has the authenticated user's name as its first path segment, rather than trusting the chi `{userID}` route param in isolation: `require strings.HasPrefix(cleanedRemote, userID+"/") || cleanedRemote == userID`.
- Defense in depth: the restic server should canonicalize and `..`-reject incoming object paths even when `--private-repos` is off, so that no backend is relied upon to neutralize traversal.
