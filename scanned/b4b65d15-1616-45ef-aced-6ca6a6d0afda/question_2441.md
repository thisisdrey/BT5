# Q2441: Vault async redeem flow: partial withdraw / free asset edge / proportional reserve

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption while the manager approves redemptions while `lastNav` is fresh and `navStart` is idle and make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side, breaking the rule that claimableRedeemShares[controller] and claimableRedeemAssets[controller] should decay proportionally to each claim and leading to User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption
- Exploit idea: make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side
- Invariant to test: claimableRedeemShares[controller] and claimableRedeemAssets[controller] should decay proportionally to each claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Exhaust a controller's claimable redemption in alternating share and asset units and assert no dust or reserve mismatch remains.
