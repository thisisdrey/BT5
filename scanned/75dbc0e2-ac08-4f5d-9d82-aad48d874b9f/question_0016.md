# Q0016: remove_code can undercharge real execution cost

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `remove_code` with crafted IDs, hashes, nonces, or location fields so the runtime charges less weight or fee than the VM, host functions, or nested runtime work actually consume?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/contracts/src/lib.rs::remove_code
- Entrypoint: public VM / contract execution extrinsic `remove_code`
- Attacker controls: IDs, hashes, nonces, or location fields
- Exploit idea: Push the largest legal code paths, nested calls, and revert patterns to find a mismatch between charged and real execution cost.
- Invariant to test: Charged weight and fees must upper-bound the exact VM and host work performed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Chain halt / block-production slowdown from undercharged VM execution
- Fast validation: Fuzz gas, storage-deposit, code size, call depth, and nested-call patterns; compare measured cost to charged cost.
