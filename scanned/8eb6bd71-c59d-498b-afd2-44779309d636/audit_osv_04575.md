# [M] Discourse: Private Chat Threat Message Disclosure via Chat Onebox Channel/Threat ID Mismatch

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: BIT-discourse-2026-72724
Aliases: CVE-2026-72724, GHSA-8g98-fvfc-9w48
Ecosystem: Bitnami
Published: 2026-08-17
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-discourse-2026-72724
Type: osv

## Affected
- Bitnami: `discourse` — affected >=2026.6.0 <2026.6.1

## Details
Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to 2026.1.6, 2026.5.2, 2026.6.1, and 2026.7.0, plugins/chat/lib/chat/onebox_handler.rb resolves Chat::Thread by route thread_id independently of the route channel_id before checking whether the user can preview the selected chat channel. An authenticated user can pair a public channel ID with a private thread ID in a /onebox.json request and obtain private thread message content. This issue is fixed in versions 2026.1.6, 2026.5.2, 2026.6.1, and 2026.7.0.
