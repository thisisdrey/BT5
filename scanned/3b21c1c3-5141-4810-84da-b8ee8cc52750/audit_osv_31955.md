## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/gup: reject FOLL_SPLIT_PMD with hugetlb VMAs

Patch series "mm: fixes for device-exclusive entries (hmm)", v2.

Discussing the PageTail() call in make_device_exclusive_range() with
Willy, I recently discovered [1] that device-exclusive handling does not
properly work with THP, making the hmm-tests selftests fail if THPs are
enabled on the system.

Looking into more details, I found that hugetlb is not properly fenced,
and I realized that something that was bugging me for longer -- how
device-exclusive entries interact with mapcounts -- completely breaks
migration/swapout/split/hwpoison handling of these folios while they have
device-exclusive PTEs.

The program below can be used to allocate 1 GiB worth of pages and making
them device-exclusive on a kernel with CONFIG_TEST_HMM.

Once they are device-exclusive, these folios cannot get swapped out
(proc$pid/smaps_rollup will always indicate 1 GiB RSS no matter how much
one forces memory reclaim), and when having a memory block onlined to
ZONE_MOVABLE, trying to offline it will loop forever and complain about
failed migration of a page that should be movable.

# echo offline > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory136/state
# echo online_movable > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory136/state
# ./hmm-swap &
... wait until everything is device-exclusive
# echo offline > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory136/state

This series fixes all issues I found so far.  There is no easy way to fix
without a bigger rework/cleanup.  I have a bunch of cleanups on top (some
previous sent, some the result of the discussion in v1) that I will send
out separately once this landed and I get to it.

I wish we could just use some special present PROT_NONE PTEs instead of
these (non-present, non-none) fake-swap entries; but that just results in
the same problem we keep having (lack of spare PTE bits), and staring at
other similar fake-swap entries, that ship has sailed.

With this series, make_device_exclusive() doesn't actually belong into
mm/rmap.c anymore, but I'll leave moving that for another day.

I only tested this series with the hmm-tests selftests due to lack of HW,
so I'd appreciate some testing, especially if the interaction between two
GPUs wanting a device-exclusive entry works as expected.
