## Details
Hi, team. During testing, I discovered that only privileged users or translation owners can unapprove an approved translation, but due to logical errors, any logged-in user can unapprove any approved translation. 

## Steps To Reproduce:
- Go to `https://mozilla-pontoon-staging.herokuapp.com/` and log in to your account.

- Click on `Teams` and select any team from the menu.

{F4104059}

{F4104060}

- Now, from the next menu, select any project and then select any resource you want.

{F4104061}

{F4104062}

- After that, you will have a list of strings that you can translate.

{F4104063}

- Select any string and you will see an already approved translation with green `tick` symbol.

{F4104065}

- You can check that you can't unapprove that translation because you don't have the required privileges.

- Now, prepare your proxy to capture requests and reload that page.

- In proxy history, you will see a request to the`/get-history/` endpoint. Like this one.

{F4104071}

- In response to that request, you will find the approved translation `ID`.  Copy that.

{F4104072}

- Now replace the session cookies, Anti-CSRF token, and Translation ID in this request and send this request.

```

translation=5184479&paths%5B%5D=LC_MESSAGES%2Famo.po
```

- You will see `200 OK `response.

- Reload the page, and you will see that the translation has been unapproved by a non-privileged user.

██████

- This is the code snippet responsible for the bug.
`https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon/blob/main/pontoon/translations/views.py#L361`
```python
   # Only privileged users or authors can un-approve translations
    if not (
        request.user.can_translate(locale, project)
        or request.user == translation.user
        or translation.approved
    ):
        return JsonResponse(
            {
                "status": False,
                "message": "Forbidden: You can't unapprove this translation.",
            },
            status=403,
        )

    translation.unapprove(request.user)
```
- Here the developer checks if `translation.approved` then if statement has been bypassed and translation get unapproved.

## Impact

The user can perform actions that he is not authorized to do.
