# Q3873: run_purge_with_stats is not deterministic across nodes (blockstore_purge.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `run_purge_with_stats` in `ledger/src/blockstore/blockstore_purge.rs` with a repeated operation that the code assumes happens at most once, and make the block's declared limits disagree with the work the block's transactions actually require, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `run_purge_with_stats` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `ledger/src/blockstore/blockstore_purge.rs` -> `run_purge_with_stats()` (around line 188)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a repeated operation that the code assumes happens at most once
- Exploit idea: Find input to `run_purge_with_stats` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `run_purge_with_stats` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `run_purge_with_stats` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
