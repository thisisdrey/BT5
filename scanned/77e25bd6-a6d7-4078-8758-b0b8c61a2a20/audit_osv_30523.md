# [H] drm/amd/display: Adjust VSDB parser for replay feature

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2024-53108
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H)
Published: 2024-12-02
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2024-53108
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=6.6.0 <6.6.63, >=6.7.0 <6.11.10

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Adjust VSDB parser for replay feature

At some point, the IEEE ID identification for the replay check in the
AMD EDID was added. However, this check causes the following
out-of-bounds issues when using KASAN:

[   27.804016] BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in amdgpu_dm_update_freesync_caps+0xefa/0x17a0 [amdgpu]

[   27.821268] ==================================================================

This is caused because the ID extraction happens outside of the range of
the edid lenght. This commit addresses this issue by considering the
amd_vsdb_block size.
