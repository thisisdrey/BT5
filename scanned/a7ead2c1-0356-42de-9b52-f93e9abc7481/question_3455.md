# Q3455: trie iterator bounds on attacker-shaped subtrees — outgoing_metadata.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys, a subtree shaped to maximise iterator depth with prefixes that share long extensions, with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes, and additionally with a value stored directly at a full 16-way branch node, reach `update_on_receipt_popped` in `core/store/src/trie/outgoing_metadata.rs` and make iteration skip or repeat entries, changing a state-derived result, breaking the invariant that iteration visits every key in the prefix exactly once, in canonical order, leading to Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/trie/outgoing_metadata.rs` :: `update_on_receipt_popped`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys
- Attacker controls: a subtree shaped to maximise iterator depth with prefixes that share long extensions; with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes; with a value stored directly at a full 16-way branch node
- Exploit idea: make iteration skip or repeat entries, changing a state-derived result
- Invariant to test: iteration visits every key in the prefix exactly once, in canonical order
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork
- Fast validation: property test comparing iteration against a reference key set
