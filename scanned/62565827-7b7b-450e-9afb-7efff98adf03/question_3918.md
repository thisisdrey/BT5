# Q3918: Smart account deployment and initialization: duplicate entries / foreign context configure / predictability

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays while the factory is deploying a brand-new Safe through the standard proxy path and make an attacker use the factory's configuration logic to alter a Safe or Safe-like context it should not own, breaking the rule that the predicted address for a given deployer, nonce, and initializer should match exactly one controllable deployment outcome and leading to Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays
- Exploit idea: make an attacker use the factory's configuration logic to alter a Safe or Safe-like context it should not own
- Invariant to test: the predicted address for a given deployer, nonce, and initializer should match exactly one controllable deployment outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account
- Fast validation: Check that no foreign Safe or Safe-like contract can abuse the factory's delegatecall-based initializer to install new module state.
