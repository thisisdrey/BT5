# Q3964: Smart account deployment and initialization: duplicate entries / unexpected privilege / ownership binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays while the resulting Safe will immediately be used against TrustedCalls or TrustedSpender surfaces and make duplicate or crafted initializer arrays install more delegate or allowance surface than intended, breaking the rule that deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold and leading to Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays
- Exploit idea: make duplicate or crafted initializer arrays install more delegate or allowance surface than intended
- Invariant to test: deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account
- Fast validation: Fuzz initializer arrays and duplicate entries, then assert the resulting Safe has exactly the declared owners, threshold, delegates, and routes.
