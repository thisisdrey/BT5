# Q1911: next-liquidity-index via collateral-remove-redeem: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
`next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `min-underlying`, use that to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `next-liquidity-index` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
