- npm: `9router` — affected >=0

## Details
## Summary

The fix for CVE-2026-46339 (unauthenticated RCE via unprotected MCP plugin routes) introduced a local-only access gate in `src/dashboardGuard.js` that restricts spawn-capable routes (`/api/mcp/*`, `/api/tunnel/*`, `/api/cli-tools/*`) to loopback requests. The gate determines "local" by inspecting the `Host` and `Origin` HTTP headers rather than the TCP source address. When 9router is deployed behind a reverse proxy, tunnel (Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale — both natively supported), or is subject to DNS rebinding, these headers are attacker-controlled, allowing the local-only gate to be bypassed.

A second factor (CLI token or JWT cookie) is required by `canAccessLocalOnlyRoute()`, but the CLI token is a deterministic HMAC of the machine ID (`getConsistentMachineId`), which is stable and predictable on cloud VMs. If the attacker can obtain or guess the machine ID (e.g., via another information disclosure, or on shared-tenant infrastructure), the full chain to MCP child process stdin injection is reachable.

This is a variant / incomplete fix of CVE-2026-46339 — the same attack surface (remote → MCP child process stdin) remains reachable under specific but realistic deployment configurations.

## Root Cause

`isLocalRequest()` at `src/dashboardGuard.js:93-101`:

```javascript
function isLocalRequest(request) {
  if (!isLoopbackHostname(request.headers.get("host"))) return false;
  const origin = request.headers.get("origin");
  if (origin) {
    try {
      if (!isLoopbackHostname(new URL(origin).hostname)) return false;
    } catch { return false; }
  }
  return true;
}
```

This function trusts `Host` and `Origin` headers as proof of local origin. Both are attacker-controlled in any proxied deployment. The `LOOPBACK_HOSTS` set (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) is checked against these headers, not against the actual connection source IP.

## Attack Scenario

### Scenario 1: Cloudflare Tunnel / Tailscale Funnel

9router natively supports Cloudflare Tunnel and Tailscale (see `LOCAL_ONLY_PATHS` entries for `/api/tunnel/*`). When exposed via tunnel:

1. Attacker sends request to `https://<tunnel-domain>/api/mcp/<plugin>/sse`
2. Sets `Host: localhost:3000` and `Origin: http://localhost:3000`
3. `isLocalRequest()` returns `true`
4. `canAccessLocalOnlyRoute()` then requires CLI token or (local + JWT)
5. CLI token is `getConsistentMachineId("9r-cli-auth")` — a deterministic HMAC of the machine's hardware/OS identifiers

### Scenario 2: DNS Rebinding

1. Attacker controls `evil.com` DNS, initially resolving to attacker IP
2. Victim's browser navigates to `evil.com` (or via iframe/redirect)
3. DNS rebinding switches `evil.com` → `127.0.0.1`
4. Subsequent fetch to `evil.com:3000/api/mcp/<plugin>/message` reaches 9router
5. `Host` header is `evil.com:3000` — this is **blocked** by the current check (not in LOOPBACK_HOSTS)
6. However, if the attacker uses `localhost:3000` as the request host via CORS or service worker tricks, and the browser sends `Host: localhost:3000`, the gate opens

### Exploitation (when CLI token is obtained)

Once past the gate, the attacker can:

1. `GET /api/mcp/<plugin>/sse` — establish SSE session, get `sessionId`
2. `POST /api/mcp/<plugin>/message` — send arbitrary JSON-RPC to the child process stdin
3. The child process is one of: `npx`, `node`, `python`, `python3`, `uvx`, `bunx`, `bun`
4. Depending on the MCP plugin implementation, this can achieve arbitrary code execution on the host

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Deploy 9router behind a reverse proxy or tunnel
2. From a remote host, send:

```http
GET /api/mcp/browser/sse HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Origin: http://localhost:3000
x-9r-cli-token: <machine-id-derived-token>
```

3. Observe: SSE connection established, `endpoint` event received with message URL
4. POST arbitrary JSON-RPC to the message endpoint

## Impact

An attacker who can reach a proxied/tunneled 9router instance and obtain the deterministic CLI token can bypass the local-only restriction and interact with MCP child processes (node, python, npx, etc.) via stdin. This achieves the same impact as CVE-2026-46339: remote code execution on the host.

The severity is reduced from CVE-2026-46339's CVSS 10.0 because:
- Requires proxied/tunneled deployment (not default localhost-only)
- Requires obtaining the CLI token (deterministic but not trivially guessable without another primitive)

## Remediation

1. **Check actual source IP, not headers.** Use `request.ip`, `request.socket.remoteAddress`, or a trusted `X-Forwarded-For` header with known proxy configuration instead of `Host`/`Origin` for the local-only gate.

2. **Make CLI token non-deterministic.** Generate a random token on first run and persist it, rather than deriving from machine ID. Machine IDs are often predictable or discoverable on cloud infrastructure.

3. **Bind MCP routes to loopback at the network layer.** If MCP is local-only by design, the server should bind those routes to `127.0.0.1` only, not rely on middleware header checks.
