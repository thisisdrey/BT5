# Q0666: calc-cumulative-debt via redeem: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `amount` of shares burned, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index, so the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `redeem` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` of shares burned across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-cumulative-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
