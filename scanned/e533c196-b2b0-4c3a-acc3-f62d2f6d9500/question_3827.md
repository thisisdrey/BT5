# Q3827: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: finite allowance / safe confusion / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls while another Safe has a similar delegate or recipient topology but no matching route and make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping
- Fast validation: Fuzz allowance expiry at the block boundary and ensure no post-expiry transfer succeeds for ERC20 or ERC721 routes.
