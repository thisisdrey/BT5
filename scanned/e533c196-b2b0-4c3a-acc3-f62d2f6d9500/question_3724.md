# Q3724: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: nft route / route widening / no cross-route bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances while the route exists with a current positive allowance or a current NFT blanket approval and spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe, breaking the rule that a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances
- Exploit idea: spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe
- Invariant to test: a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient
- Fast validation: Forge test one delegate across several Safes and routes and assert each transfer consumes only the exact approved route.
