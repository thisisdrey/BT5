# [H] nnU-Net: Agentic workflow injection in `.github/workflows/issue-triage.yml` of `MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet`

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-44246
Aliases: GHSA-63mx-j37w-gh59
CVSS: 7.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
Published: 2026-05-12
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-44246
Type: osv

## Details
nnU-Net is a semantic segmentation framework that automatically adapts its pipeline to a dataset. Prior to 2.4.1, the nnU-Net Issue Triage workflow in .github/workflows/issue-triage.yml is vulnerable to Agentic Workflow Injection. The workflow sets allowed_non_write_users: ${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}, which means any logged-in GitHub user who opens an issue can reach this agentic workflow with attacker-controlled content. Untrusted issue title and body content are embedded directly into the prompt of anthropics/claude-code-action, and the workflow then runs a command-capable Claude agent with permission to comment on and relabel the current issue via gh. Because this workflow is triggered automatically on issues.opened, an external attacker can submit a crafted issue that steers the agent beyond its intended issue-triage purpose and influences authenticated issue actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.1.
