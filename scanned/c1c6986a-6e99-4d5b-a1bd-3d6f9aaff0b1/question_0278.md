# Q0278: normalize-pyth via liquidate-multi: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), can an unprivileged attacker make `normalize-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297) convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? `normalize-pyth` computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297` -> `normalize-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `normalize-pyth` computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) varied, and assert that the value `normalize-pyth` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
