# [H] Open WebUI: Any authenticated user can reach the Azure platform channel via server-side web fetch

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-87999
Aliases: GHSA-34r3-9m95-vq73
CVSS: 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N)

Type: osv

## Details
Open WebUI is an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted AI platform. Prior to 0.11.1, POST /api/v1/retrieval/process/web and POST /api/v1/retrieval/process/web/search in backend/open_webui/retrieval/web/utils.py treated Python's globally routable address classification as proof that a destination was external. An authenticated user could make an Azure-hosted instance fetch and return content from 168.63.129.16, the Azure platform channel, as well as other reserved ranges that the standard classification did not reject. This issue is fixed in version 0.11.1.
