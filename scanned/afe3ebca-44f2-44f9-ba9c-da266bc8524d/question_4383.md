# Q4383: add-user-collateral via transfer: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `transfer` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `add-user-collateral` touches, run `transfer` with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
