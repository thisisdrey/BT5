# Q4012: process-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `process-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761` -> `process-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
