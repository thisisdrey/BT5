# Q3956: distribute_partitioned_epoch_rewards charges far less than it costs (distribution.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `distribute_partitioned_epoch_rewards` in `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/distribution.rs` with a denominator that the attacker can drive to zero or one, and make the real CPU/memory cost of `distribute_partitioned_epoch_rewards` exceed the units charged for it, so that the invariant "Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/distribution.rs` -> `distribute_partitioned_epoch_rewards()` (around line 80)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a denominator that the attacker can drive to zero or one
- Exploit idea: Find the input shape where `distribute_partitioned_epoch_rewards`'s real CPU/memory/IO cost grows much faster than the compute units or fee charged for it.
- Invariant to test: Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Measure real time/allocations versus units charged across input sizes; assert cost/CU ratio stays bounded.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply force sigverify, dedup, scheduling, or buffering work that vastly exceeds the fees ever collected, degrading the leader below true cost.
