# Q312: Entry-Function Wedge in transfer_coins

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `aptos_framework::aptos_account::transfer_coins` with pathological but valid inputs that cause abort loops, excessive work, or state growth severe enough to wedge validators or materially stall users?

## Target
- File/function: aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/aptos_account.move::aptos_framework::aptos_account::transfer_coins
- Entrypoint: Submit an entry-function transaction invoking `aptos_framework::aptos_account::transfer_coins` or the direct user flow that reaches it.
- Attacker controls: amounts, recipient addresses, object IDs, property maps, collection and token names, seeds, beneficiaries, operator choices, and lockup-related inputs
- Exploit idea: Use user-controlled entry arguments to force disproportionate execution cost or pathological state transitions in a default-enabled path.
- Invariant to test: User-facing entry functions must remain bounded and must not induce pathological state growth or repeated abort behavior under valid inputs.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Consensus or safety violation, invalid state commitment, total loss of liveness, validator-crashing input, proven cryptographic break, or unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork, when triggered by unprivileged transaction, package, API, or state input rather than by malicious peers or node operators.
- Fast validation: Add a Move or e2e stress test with adversarial valid inputs and assert bounded gas, bounded state growth, and no pathological retry pattern.
