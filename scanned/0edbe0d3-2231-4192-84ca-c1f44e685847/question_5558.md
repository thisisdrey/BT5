# Q5558: transaction validity window across a fork — chunk_validation.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through `broadcast_tx_commit` / `send_tx` RPC carrying a SignedTransaction signed by an ordinary FullAccess key, a transaction pinned to a block hash at the edge of the validity window, when the same transaction is replayable across a reorg at the window edge, and additionally when execution depends on data the witness does not fully determine, reach `validate_chunk_state_witness` in `chain/chain/src/stateless_validation/chunk_validation.rs` and get the same transaction accepted on one branch and expired on another, then replayed, breaking the invariant that a transaction executes at most once across all branches that survive, leading to Critical - Direct loss of funds (protocol-level balance created, destroyed, or moved outside protocol rules)?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/chain/src/stateless_validation/chunk_validation.rs` :: `validate_chunk_state_witness`
- Entrypoint: `broadcast_tx_commit` / `send_tx` RPC carrying a SignedTransaction signed by an ordinary FullAccess key
- Attacker controls: a transaction pinned to a block hash at the edge of the validity window; when the same transaction is replayable across a reorg at the window edge; when execution depends on data the witness does not fully determine
- Exploit idea: get the same transaction accepted on one branch and expired on another, then replayed
- Invariant to test: a transaction executes at most once across all branches that survive
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct loss of funds (protocol-level balance created, destroyed, or moved outside protocol rules)
- Fast validation: test-loop test replaying a window-edge transaction across a reorg
