# Q1830: Exchange offer lifecycle: address-book churn / lock residue / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance while the offer contains multiple loans whose economic state can diverge while storage stays static and make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance
- Exploit idea: make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement
- Fast validation: Simulate cancel/relist cycles and ensure no listed loan remains locked or economically bound to a dead offer.
