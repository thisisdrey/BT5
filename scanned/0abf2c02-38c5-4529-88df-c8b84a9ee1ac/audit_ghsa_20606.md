# [M] Denial of Service in graphql-go

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-mh3m-8c74-74xh
CVE: CVE-2022-21708
CWE: CWE-400
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2022-01-27
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mh3m-8c74-74xh
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go` — affected >=0 <1.3.0

## Details
### Impact
This is a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. To make things worse the only mitigation in affected versions creates opportunities for other attacks. This issue is only available if you are using `graphql.MaxDepth` option in your schema (which is highly recommended in most cases).

### Patches
The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. We have been trying to maintain backwards compatibility and avoid breaking changes so upgrading should not be problematic. 

### Workarounds
The best workaround is to patch to a version greater than or equal to `v1.3.0`. 
Otherwise, the only workaround in versions prior to `v1.3.0` is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema. Unfortunately, this could potentially create opportunities for other attacks.
