## Details
Hi IBB,

I'd like to submit a issue exist in Mercurial.
```
It is possible that a specially malformed repository can cause Git subrepositories to run arbitrary code in 
the form of a .git/hooks/post-update script checked in to the repository in Mercurial 4.4 and earlier. 
Typical use of Mercurial prevents construction of such repositories, but they can be created 
programmatically.
```
