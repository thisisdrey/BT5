# [H] dd-trace-rb: Improper parsing of W3C baggage headers may lead to DoS

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-p5f6-rccc-jv98
CVE: CVE-2026-50276
CWE: CWE-400, CWE-770
Ecosystem: RubyGems
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-07-15
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p5f6-rccc-jv98
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- RubyGems: `datadog` — affected >=0 <2.32.0

## Details
### Impact
Datadog tracing libraries that implement W3C baggage propagation parse incoming baggage HTTP headers without enforcing item-count or byte-size limits on the extract path. The DD_TRACE_BAGGAGE_MAX_ITEMS (default 64) and DD_TRACE_BAGGAGE_MAX_BYTES (default 8192) limits were applied only to baggage injection, not extraction. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a request whose baggage header contains an arbitrarily large number of comma-separated key-value pairs (or a single very large value). The tracer allocates a hash-map entry for each pair on every request, causing unbounded CPU and memory consumption and enabling a remote Denial of Service against any HTTP service that has the baggage propagation style enabled.
The baggage propagation style is enabled by default in most affected tracers, so any internet-facing service that has been instrumented with an affected tracer version is exposed unless the propagation style has been explicitly narrowed.

### Patches
This is resolved in version 2.32.0 and later of the `dd-trace-rb` library.

### Workarounds
If users cannot upgrade immediately:
1. Disable `baggage` extraction by removing `baggage` from `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE` (or `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE_EXTRACT` if set independently).
2. Cap the maximum HTTP request header size at an upstream proxy or web server (for example, Apache `LimitRequestFieldSize`, Nginx `large_client_header_buffers`, Envoy `max_request_headers_kb`).
