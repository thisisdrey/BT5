# Q2923: Address-book role bit isolation: role reuse / whitelist bypass / precise unregister

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with the same attacker-controlled grantee registered under several Roles values in the same book while the same grantee address is intentionally present under multiple roles for legitimate reasons and make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present, breaking the rule that unregistering one role should not leave or remove unrelated role authority unexpectedly and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution after a wrong-role counterparty enters the lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: the same attacker-controlled grantee registered under several Roles values in the same book
- Exploit idea: make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present
- Invariant to test: unregistering one role should not leave or remove unrelated role authority unexpectedly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution after a wrong-role counterparty enters the lifecycle
- Fast validation: Model one self-managed book plus the canonical book and assert they can never substitute for each other.
