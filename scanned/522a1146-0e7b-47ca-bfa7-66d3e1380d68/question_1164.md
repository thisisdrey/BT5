# Q1164: Investor withdrawal routing: mixed balances / batch bleed / no stale unlocker

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value while the first loan in the batch is unlocked and fixes the recipient as the current investor and make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it, breaking the rule that a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch and leading to Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value
- Exploit idea: make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it
- Invariant to test: a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows
- Fast validation: Forge test mixed locked/unlocked batches, duplicate ids, and ownership transfers, then assert each loan pays exactly one valid recipient once.
