# Q0372: Loans funding and disbursement state: standing allowance / wrong investor pull / same-loan accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing while a vault, buyer, or downstream counterparty could rely on the resulting balances after funding or disbursement and make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan, breaking the rule that funding or disbursing one loan should never create withdrawable or priceable balances attributable to another loan or investor and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution between investor, borrower, and originator paths?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing
- Exploit idea: make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan
- Invariant to test: funding or disbursing one loan should never create withdrawable or priceable balances attributable to another loan or investor
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution between investor, borrower, and originator paths
- Fast validation: Forge test ownership changes, lock cycles, and standing allowances around `fund`, then assert only the current NFT owner can move capital exactly once.
