# Q3589: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: expiry edge / expiry bypass / per-safe route binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries while the route exists with a current positive allowance or a current NFT blanket approval and spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid, breaking the rule that delegate rights and allowances should bind to one exact `(safe, token-or-collection, recipient)` route only and leading to Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries
- Exploit idea: spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid
- Invariant to test: delegate rights and allowances should bind to one exact `(safe, token-or-collection, recipient)` route only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts
- Fast validation: Model repeated finite-allowance transfers and assert the stored allowance matches the exact total transferred.
