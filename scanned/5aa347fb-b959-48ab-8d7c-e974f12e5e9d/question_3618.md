# Q3618: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: expiry edge / safe confusion / strict expiry

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries while there are several recipient routes for the same Safe and token or collection and make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context, breaking the rule that expired allowances should never authorize any further ERC20 or ERC721 movement and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context
- Invariant to test: expired allowances should never authorize any further ERC20 or ERC721 movement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient
- Fast validation: Forge test one delegate across several Safes and routes and assert each transfer consumes only the exact approved route.
