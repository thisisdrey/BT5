## Details
# If  bull/bear makes the whitelist big enough then the function `buyPosition` will cause a lot of gas and possibility revert

## Summary
If  bull/bear makes the whitelist big enough then the function `buyPosition` will cause a lot of gas and possibility revert
Since we are looping through many addresses and there is no limit to the array and no way to remove the whitelist or make it shorter so the function will cause a lot of gas and cause dos.
## Vulnerability Detail
ex:
If the bull wants to sell its position and they whitelist a lot of addresses and then the buyer tries to buy it, it will cost a lot of gas and maybe revert and cause dos to the function.
## Impact
Let's say the bull approves 100 addresses then the buyer will loop through all those addresses looking for his address which can be at the last of the array and will cost at least 6 gas per iteration adding to a lot of gas, causing dos which then the buyer will either pay a lot of gas or will not be able to buy the position.
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
    function isWhitelisted(address[] memory whitelist, address buyer)
        public
        pure
        returns (bool)
    {
        for (uint256 i; i < whitelist.length; i++) {
            if (buyer == whitelist[i]) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Put a limit on how many addresses can be added but also a way to remove the address on the fly or a way to just check one msg.sender.
