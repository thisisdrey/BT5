# Q1618: compute_unit_price_in_microlamports can persist state that blocks later replay (transaction_meta.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `compute_unit_price_in_microlamports` in `runtime-transaction/src/transaction_meta.rs` with an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data, and commit state through `compute_unit_price_in_microlamports` that a later load or restart refuses to accept, so that the invariant "Any state this path can commit is loadable by the same version on restart." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/transaction_meta.rs` -> `compute_unit_price_in_microlamports()` (around line 77)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data
- Exploit idea: Commit account/ledger state through `compute_unit_price_in_microlamports` that a later load rejects, so every node fails replay after restart and needs manual intervention.
- Invariant to test: Any state this path can commit is loadable by the same version on restart.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Write the crafted state, restart the bank from it in a test, and assert replay completes.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged remote client can send TPU/QUIC traffic or transaction packets that panic, deadlock, or unboundedly grow memory in ingress, sigverify, scheduling, or PoH, halting block production across the cluster.
