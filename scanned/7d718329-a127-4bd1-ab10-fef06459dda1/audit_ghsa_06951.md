# [M] Auth.js: OAuth state, nonce, and PKCE check cookies are not bound to the provider that created them

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-x445-f3h2-j279
CVE: CVE-2026-73419
CWE: CWE-345, CWE-346, CWE-940
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-07-23
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x445-f3h2-j279
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- npm: `@auth/core` — affected >=0 <0.41.3
- npm: `next-auth` — affected >=5.0.0-beta.1 <5.0.0-beta.32
- npm: `next-auth` — affected >=0 <4.24.15

## Details
## Summary

Auth.js stores the OAuth/OIDC anti-CSRF checks (`state`, `nonce`, and the PKCE verifier) in global cookies that are not bound to the provider that created them. On callback, a check value minted during a sign-in started with one provider can satisfy the callback for a different provider, because the stored cookie is not verified against the callback provider's identity (provider id, issuer, client id, or redirect URI). In a multi-provider app that allows account linking while logged in, this provider-confusion / mix-up condition can let an attacker link their account at a second provider to a victim's user.

## Am I affected?

You may be affected if **all** of the following hold:

- You use `next-auth` `<= 4.24.14` or `>= 5.0.0-beta.1, <= 5.0.0-beta.31`, or `@auth/core` `<= 0.41.2`.
- You configure multiple OAuth/OIDC providers.
- You allow users to link additional providers while logged in.
- At least one configured provider's authorization request is observable by an attacker, and at least one target provider's callback can be satisfied without a PKCE verifier (i.e. it relies only on `state` or only on `nonce`).

You are **not** affected if you use a single OAuth provider, do not allow logged-in account linking, or all providers enforce PKCE.

## Impact

- Account-linking confusion: an attacker can get their account at a target provider linked to the victim's Auth.js user, granting the attacker persistent sign-in to the victim's account through that linked provider.
- Exploitation requires luring the victim into starting a legitimate same-origin flow; it cannot be performed by cross-site request forgery alone, which reduces practical likelihood.

## Patched version

The fix binds the OAuth check cookies to the provider/authorization flow that created them, so a callback cannot consume a check value minted for a different provider. Upgrade to the first releases containing this fix (pending; this advisory will be updated with exact patched versions before publication).

## Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade immediately:

- Enable PKCE (`checks: ["pkce"]`, in addition to `state`/`nonce`) on every provider that supports it; PKCE blocks the practical code-swap variant because the attacker cannot observe the relying party's verifier.
- Avoid offering logged-in account linking across multiple providers where one provider is lower-trust or attacker-observable.
- Treat `events.linkAccount` as sensitive: add audit logging, user notification, or out-of-band confirmation so that any unexpected link is visible (defense-in-depth, not a root-cause fix).
