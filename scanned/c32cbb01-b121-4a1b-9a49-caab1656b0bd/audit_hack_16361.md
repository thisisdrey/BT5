## Details
# Basing fees on the current pending position magnitude instead of the amount being closed can lead to incorrect fee calculations
## Summary
This code does have an issue in how it calculates fees based on the current pending position magnitude rather than the amount being closed.
## Vulnerability Detail
This code does have an issue in how it calculates fees based on the current pending position magnitude rather than the amount being closed.
The key parts are:
1. In _liquidate, it calls _liquidationFee to get the liquidation fee.
2. _liquidationFee calls _latest to get the latest pending position and price.
3. _latest loops through pending positions, updating latestPosition and closableAmount.
4. It returns latestPosition.magnitude() for closableAmount.
5. _liquidationFee uses closableAmount as the amount when calculating the liquidation fee.
The problem is that closableAmount is the full magnitude of the latest pending position, not the amount being closed. If the position was previously larger but is now smaller, the fee will be larger than it should be.
For example:
• Current position is 100 DSU
• New pending position is 50 DSU
• Only 50 DSU is being closed
• But closableAmount will be 100
• So fee is calculated on 100 instead of actual 50 being closed



## Impact
Users could pay excess fees if their position reduces in size.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
_latest should track the actual delta of DSU being closed, not just the latest magnitude. This accurately tracks the amount being closed rather than just using the latest magnitude.
