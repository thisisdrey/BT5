# Q2143: is-healthy-with-mask via liquidate-multi: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the full batch list and its ordering, use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, then read `is-healthy-with-mask` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
