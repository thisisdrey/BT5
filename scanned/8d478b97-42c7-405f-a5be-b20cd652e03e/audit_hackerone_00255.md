# [C] (Authenticated) RCE by bypassing of the .htaccess blacklist

## Summary
Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.0)
Program: Nextcloud
Weakness: Code Injection

## Details
`Storage::copyFromStorage` doesn't check the content of a folder it copies against the list of blacklisted files.
Meaning that if a user has access to an external storage (inc. fed. shares) that contains a .htaccess file, he can move the .htaccess file to the local data directory.

The attack works on any nextcloud/owncloud since federated sharing was introduced that uses apache and has the data directory inside the webroot (as is default)

Steps to reproduce:
- Setup an evil instance (nc1) that has the file blacklist disabled (Filesystem.php line 616)
- create a folder 'sharefolder/attack' in nc1 with the following files
  - .htaccess configured to "allow from all"
  - attack.php with the desired attack
- Setup a non-evil instance (nc2) (or pick an existing nc instance that you want to attack)
- Federated share 'sharefolder' from nc1 to nc2
- In nc2, move 'sharefolder/attack' to 'attack' (outside the share)
- navigate to http://nc2/data/userid/files/attack/attack.php
