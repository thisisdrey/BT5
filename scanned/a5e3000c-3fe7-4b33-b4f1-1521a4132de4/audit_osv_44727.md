# [M] tokenizers BpeBuilder Buffer Overflow via merge token

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-85670
CVSS: 6.0 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)

Type: osv

## Details
tokenizers (Hugging Face) is affected by an out-of-bounds buffer access in BpeBuilder::build (tokenizers/src/models/bpe/model.rs). When loading a tokenizer.json via Tokenizer::from_file/from_str, the builder sizes a scratch buffer to the longest vocabulary key, then writes each concatenated merge rule into it. A merge whose concatenated token exceeds the longest vocabulary key overruns the buffer, which Rust turns into a panic that aborts the process in Rust and FFI embeddings. This occurs at load time with no encoding required, so an attacker who supplies a crafted tokenizer.json can cause a denial of service. A secondary defect at the same location can cause a usize underflow (panic in debug, potential memory corruption in release) when continuing_subword_prefix is set and a merge token is shorter than the prefix. Observed in version 0.23.1.
