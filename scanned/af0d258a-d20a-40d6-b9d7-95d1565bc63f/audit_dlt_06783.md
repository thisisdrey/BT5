# Vulnerability details

The Vultisig token, as described in its documentation, is expected to include a burnable feature. However, the current implementation of the Vultisig token contract lacks the necessary functions to support token burning. This report identifies the impact of this missing functionality and provides a recommended solution to implement the burn feature. The vultisig stated that they forgot to add this functionality.
## Impact

**Non-compliance with Documentation:** Users and developers relying on the documentation will expect burn functionality, leading to confusion and potential loss of trust when they find it missing.
## Proof of concept 

As you can see from the code below function for burning is missing, consider adding it to the code. 

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import {IApproveAndCallReceiver} from "./interfaces/IApproveAndCallReceiver.sol";

/**
 * @title ERC20 based Vultisig token contract
 */
contract Vultisig is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor() ERC20("Vultisig Token", "VULT") {
        _mint(_msgSender(), 100_000_000 * 1e18);
    }

    function approveAndCall(
        address spender,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata extraData
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Approve the spender to spend the tokens
        _approve(msg.sender, spender, amount);

        // Call the receiveApproval function on the spender contract
        IApproveAndCallReceiver(spender).receiveApproval(
            msg.sender,
            amount,
            address(this),
            extraData
        );

        return true;
    }
}

```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
To address this issue, the following burn functions should be added to the Vultisig contract:

1. **Burn Function:**
    
    - Allows token holders to destroy a specified amount of their own tokens.
2. **Burn From Function:**
    
    - Allows an account to burn tokens from another account, given that the caller has sufficient allowance.

Here is the modified contract with the added burn functionality:
Something like this can be added to the `Vultisig` code:

    }

    function approveAndCall(
        address spender,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata extraData
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Approve the spender to spend the tokens

        // Call the receiveApproval function on the spender contract
        IApproveAndCallReceiver(spender).receiveApproval(
            msg.sender,
            amount,
            address(this),
            extraData
        );

        return true;
    }

+    function burn(uint256 amount) public {
+        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
+    }

+    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public {
+        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(account, msg.sender);
+        require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds + allowance");
+        _approve(account, msg.sender, currentAllowance - amount);
+        _burn(account, amount);
+    }
}

```
