# [M] OAuth2 Proxy has an Authorization Bypass in Email Domain Validation via Malformed Multi-@ Email Claims

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-c5c4-8r6x-56w3
CVE: CVE-2026-40574
CWE: CWE-863
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-04-15
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c5c4-8r6x-56w3
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/v7` — affected >=0 <7.15.2

## Details
### Impact

An authorization bypass exists in OAuth2 Proxy as part of the `email_domain` enforcement option. An attacker may be able to authenticate with an email claim such as `attacker@evil.com@company.com` and satisfy an allowed domain check for `company.com`, even though the claim is not a valid email address.

The issue **ONLY** affects deployments that rely on `email_domain` restrictions and accept email claim values from identity providers or claim mappings that do not strictly enforce normal email syntax. The practical risk ONLY exists in self-hosted or custom OIDC environments and federated setups where unexpected claim values can reach oauth2-proxy. Standard hosted providers that enforce valid email formatting ARE NOT effected.

### Patches
Users should upgrade to `v7.15.2` or later once available.

### Workarounds
The most effective workaround is to ensure the configured identity provider cannot emit malformed or attacker-controlled email claim values.
