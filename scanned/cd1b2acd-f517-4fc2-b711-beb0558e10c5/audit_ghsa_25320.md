# [C] Apache Flex BlazeDS unsafe deserialization

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: GHSA-w8v7-prhw-xjpw
CVE: CVE-2017-5641
CWE: CWE-502
Ecosystem: Maven
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2022-05-13
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w8v7-prhw-xjpw
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Maven: `org.apache.flex.blazeds:flex-messaging-core` — affected >=0 <4.7.3
- Maven: `org.apache.flex.blazeds:flex-messaging-remoting` — affected >=0 <4.7.3

## Details
Previous versions of Apache Flex BlazeDS (4.7.2 and earlier) did not restrict which types were allowed for AMF(X) object deserialization by default. During the deserialization process code is executed that for several known types has undesired side-effects. Other, unknown types may also exhibit such behaviors. One vector in the Java standard library exists that allows an attacker to trigger possibly further exploitable Java deserialization of untrusted data. Other known vectors in third party libraries can be used to trigger remote code execution.
