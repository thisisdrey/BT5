# Q1600: zip via liquidate: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `liquidate` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
