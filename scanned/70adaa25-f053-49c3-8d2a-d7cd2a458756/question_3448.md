# Q3448: lending_account_close_balance: account migration duplicates or strands value [multiple-active-balances-where-slot] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `lending_account_close_balance` with multiple active balances where slot reuse can occur after close so `lending_account_close_balance` duplicates, drops, or strands balances during account migration or transfer, violating `closing a balance must require truly zero economic exposure and must not drop live shares, debt, or blocking state` and causing `High: permanent value loss, account bricking, or hidden debt`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/marginfi_account/close_balance.rs` / `lending_account_close_balance`
- Entrypoint: `lending_account_close_balance`
- Attacker controls: multiple active balances where slot reuse can occur after close
- Exploit idea: Probe migration edges where balances, fees, or authorities are copied then cleared, especially if one half can be replayed or partially completed. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: closing a balance must require truly zero economic exposure and must not drop live shares, debt, or blocking state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent value loss, account bricking, or hidden debt
- Fast validation: Simulate partial completion and replay attempts, then assert total exposure across old and new accounts stays conserved. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
