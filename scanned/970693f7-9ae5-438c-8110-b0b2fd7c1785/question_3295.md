# Q3295: find-and-resolve-asset-value via borrow: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
`find-and-resolve-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668) reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree, violating the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668` -> `find-and-resolve-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Reach it through `borrow` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `find-and-resolve-asset-value` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
