# [H] Signature validation can be bypassed as return value of 0 is not checked

## Details
# Signature validation can be bypassed as return value of 0 is not checked

## Summary
`ECDSA.recover()` does not revert if the signature provided is invalid. The 0 address is returned instead. This means that a malicious attacker can pass in arbitrary order parameters to pass the signature validation check by simply setting `sellOrder.maker = address(0)`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`isValidSignature()` only checks for `return ECDSA.recover(orderHash, signature) == signer`. See OpenZeppelin's docs which notes that the 0 address will be returned when signature is invalid [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/cryptography#ECDSA-recover-bytes32-bytes-).

## Impact
Signature validation can be bypassed which breaks the entire protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add check for return value of `address(0)` in `isValidSignature()`.
```diff
    function isValidSignature(address signer, bytes32 orderHash, bytes calldata signature) public pure returns (bool) {
+       if(ECDSA.recover(orderHash,signature) == address(0)) return false;
        return ECDSA.recover(orderHash, signature) == signer;
    }
```
