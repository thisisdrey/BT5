# Q1758: Exchange offer lifecycle: relist cycle / bundle inconsistency / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled cancellation and re-listing cycles for the same loans while the deadline is close enough that ordering and timestamp boundaries matter and make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled cancellation and re-listing cycles for the same loans
- Exploit idea: make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
