# [M] blueprintUE: Active Sessions Are Not Invalidated After Password Change or Reset

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-40587
Aliases: GHSA-gqpq-x62g-p4mg
CVSS: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

Type: osv

## Details
blueprintUE is a tool to help Unreal Engine developers. Prior to 4.2.0, when a user changes their password via the profile edit page, or when a password reset is completed via the reset link, neither operation invalidates existing authenticated sessions for that user. A server-side session store associates userID → session; the current password change/reset flow updates only the password column in the users table and does not destroy or mark invalid any active sessions. As a result, an attacker who has already compromised a session retains full access to the account indefinitely — even after the legitimate user has detected the intrusion and changed their password — until the session's natural expiry time (configured as SESSION_GC_MAXLIFETIME, defaulting to 86400 seconds / 24 hours, with SESSION_LIFETIME=0 meaning persistent until browser close or GC, whichever is later). This vulnerability is fixed in 4.2.0.
