# Q4091: calc-index-next via liquidate: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) applies a multiplier to the current index. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `min-collateral-expected`, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `liquidate` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-collateral-expected`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
