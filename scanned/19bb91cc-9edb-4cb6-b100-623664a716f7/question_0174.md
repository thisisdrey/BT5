# Q0174: create via collateral-add: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling call ordering within the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz call ordering within the block across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `create` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
