# Q0097: increment via transfer: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, drive `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) — which advances the user-id nonce — to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, breaking the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `transfer` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `transfer` with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, then read `increment` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
