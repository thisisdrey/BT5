# Q108: get_asset_shares: frozen or disabled account still reaches value-moving code [a-deposit-immediately-after-a] [cycle]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker route `lending_account_deposit` through `get_asset_shares` with a deposit immediately after a permissionless price-cache refresh for the same bank so a frozen, disabled, or otherwise blocked account still changes value-bearing state, breaking `deposited assets must map to exactly one conservative internal share increase and never create withdrawable phantom value` and causing `Critical: direct theft or unauthorized withdrawal of protocol/user funds`? Focus specifically on whether the attacker can repeat the same path in a short deterministic cycle to compound a one-step drift.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/bank.rs` / `get_asset_shares`
- Entrypoint: `lending_account_deposit`
- Attacker controls: a deposit immediately after a permissionless price-cache refresh for the same bank
- Exploit idea: Test whether authority/freeze/disabled checks are performed too late, on the wrong object, or on only part of the execution path. Focus specifically on whether the attacker can repeat the same path in a short deterministic cycle to compound a one-step drift.
- Invariant to test: deposited assets must map to exactly one conservative internal share increase and never create withdrawable phantom value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: direct theft or unauthorized withdrawal of protocol/user funds
- Fast validation: Set the relevant flags, execute the controlled call, and assert that no vault transfer, share change, or balance activation occurs. Run the target path in a short deposit/withdraw or borrow/repay style loop and assert no monotonic gain appears.
