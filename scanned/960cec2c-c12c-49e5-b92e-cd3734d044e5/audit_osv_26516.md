# [M] nfc: fix memory leak of se_io context in nfc_genl_se_io

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2023-53298
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 5.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2025-09-16
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2023-53298
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=3.13.0 <4.14.308, >=4.15.0 <4.19.276, >=4.20.0 <5.4.235, >=5.5.0 <5.10.173, >=5.11.0 <5.15.100, >=5.16.0 <6.1.18, >=6.2.0 <6.2.5

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: fix memory leak of se_io context in nfc_genl_se_io

The callback context for sending/receiving APDUs to/from the selected
secure element is allocated inside nfc_genl_se_io and supposed to be
eventually freed in se_io_cb callback function. However, there are several
error paths where the bwi_timer is not charged to call se_io_cb later, and
the cb_context is leaked.

The patch proposes to free the cb_context explicitly on those error paths.

At the moment we can't simply check 'dev->ops->se_io()' return value as it
may be negative in both cases: when the timer was charged and was not.
