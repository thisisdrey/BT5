# [M] CVE-2022-27782: TLS and SSH connection too eager reuse

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Program: curl
Weakness: Business Logic Errors
Reporter: nyymi
State: resolved
Disclosed: 2022-05-11T12:40:19.095Z
CVE: CVE-2022-27782
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/1555796

## Details
## Summary:
Curl fails to consider some security related options when reusing TLS connections. For example:
- CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS
- CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_OPTIONS
- CURLOPT_CRLFILE
- CURLOPT_PROXY_CRLFILE

As a result for example TLS connection with  lower security (`CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST`,` CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE`) connection reused when it should no longer be. Also connection that has been authenticated perviously with `CURLSSLOPT_AUTO_CLIENT_CERT` might be reused for connections that should not be.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. `(echo -ne "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 6\r\n\r\nHello\n"; sleep 5; echo -ne "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 6\r\n\r\nAgain\n") | openssl s_server -cert cert.pem -key privkey.pem -cert_chain chain.pem -accept 9443`
2. `curl -v --ssl-no-revoke --ssl-allow-beast https://targethost.tld:9443 -: https://targethost.tld:9443`

Connections are made using the same reused connection even though security settings change.

With curl built against openssl:
1. `curl http://cdp.geotrust.com/GeoTrustRSACA2018.crl | openssl crl -out testcrl.pem`
2. `curl -v https://curl.se -: --crlfile crlfile.pem https://curl.se`

The crlfile.pem use should result in `curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get certificate CRL` but is ignored since previous connection is reused.

With curl built against Schannel and revoked certificate:
1. `curl -v --ssl-no-revoke https://revoked.grc.com -: https://revoked.grc.com`

Second connection will reuse the existing connection even though revocation check is no longer requested.

## Note:

There may be more options that might have the similar issues. These were the most obvious I could see (ones having obvious security impact).

## Impact

Wrong identity (client certificate) or TLS security options being used for subsequent connections to the same hosts.
