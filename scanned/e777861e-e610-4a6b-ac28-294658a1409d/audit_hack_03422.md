## Details
# transferPosition function do not transfer withdrawableCollectionTokenId to new recipient

## Summary
`transferPosition` function do not transfer `withdrawableCollectionTokenId` to new recipient. As result new recipient can't withdraw his token that is controlled by protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
When bear settles the order then protocol tries to transfer token to the bull. In case if it was not successfull(for example bull doesn't support ERC721 tokens) then this token is transferred to protocol and bull can withdraw it later.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L394-L400
```solidity
        try IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, bull, tokenId) {}
        catch (bytes memory) {
            // Transfer NFT to BvbProtocol
            IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, address(this), tokenId);
            // Store that the bull has to retrieve it
            withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId] = bull;
        }
```
As you can see recipient is provided as bull address to withdrawableCollectionTokenId variable.

To withdraw his token bull then needs to call withdrawToken function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L450-L462
```solidity
    function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public {
        address collection = matchedOrders[uint(orderHash)].collection;


        address recipient = withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId];


        // Transfer NFT to recipient
        IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId);


        // This token is not withdrawable anymore
        withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId] = address(0);


        emit WithdrawnToken(orderHash, tokenId, recipient);
    }
```
The recipient address was fetched from `withdrawableCollectionTokenId` variable.  

Also there is another function that allows bull to transfer his position to another recipient.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L521-L538
```solidity
    function transferPosition(bytes32 orderHash, bool isBull, address recipient) public {
        // ContractId
        uint contractId = uint(orderHash);


        if (isBull) {
            // Check that the msg.sender is the Bull
            require(msg.sender == bulls[contractId], "SENDER_NOT_BULL");


            bulls[contractId] = recipient;
        } else {
            // Check that the msg.sender is the Bear
            require(msg.sender == bears[contractId], "SENDER_NOT_BEAR");


            bears[contractId] = recipient;
        }


        emit TransferedPosition(orderHash, isBull, recipient);
    }
```
As you can see it doesn't update `withdrawableCollectionTokenId` variable with new recipient.

This is problem scenario.
1.Order created and matched by bull(bull doesn't conform to ERC721).
2.Bear settles order and NFT is not transferred to bull, because he doesn't support ERC721 or block token receiving.
3.`withdrawableCollectionTokenId` is provide with transferred token and address of bull
4.bull transfers his position to another account(to withdraw his token or maybe he received some money from receiver for that).
5.receiver can't withdraw the token, token is sent to previous bull.
## Impact
New receiver can't withdraw NFT that is controlled by protocol.

## Recommendation
Inside `withdrawToken` function use bull address of order to send token to.
