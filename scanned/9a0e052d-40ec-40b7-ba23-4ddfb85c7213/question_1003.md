# Q1003: can_be_closed: account-state transition skips a mandatory precondition [an-account-that-just-ended] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `close_account` with an account that just ended a flashloan or receivership phase so `can_be_closed` performs a state transition without validating a required precondition, breaking `closeability must require the full absence of live economic exposure, blocking flags, and value-bearing side state` and causing `High: permanent loss, stranding, or unauthorized release of live exposure`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `can_be_closed`
- Entrypoint: `close_account`
- Attacker controls: an account that just ended a flashloan or receivership phase
- Exploit idea: Focus on initialize/close/freeze/sync transitions where one branch may skip a check that sibling branches enforce. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: closeability must require the full absence of live economic exposure, blocking flags, and value-bearing side state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent loss, stranding, or unauthorized release of live exposure
- Fast validation: Hit the suspect branch directly in a test and assert it rejects the same invalid pre-state that other equivalent branches reject. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
