# Q4326: create via repay: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, so the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `repay` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `create` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
