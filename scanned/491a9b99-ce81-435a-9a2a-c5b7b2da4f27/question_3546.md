# Q3546: debt-add-scaled via liquidate-multi: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the full batch list and its ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller, so the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `debt-add-scaled` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
