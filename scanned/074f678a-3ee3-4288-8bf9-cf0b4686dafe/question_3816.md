# Q3816: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: finite allowance / expiry bypass / no cross-route bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls while there are several recipient routes for the same Safe and token or collection and spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid, breaking the rule that a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar and leading to Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls
- Exploit idea: spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid
- Invariant to test: a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts
- Fast validation: Model repeated finite-allowance transfers and assert the stored allowance matches the exact total transferred.
