# Q3699: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: shared delegate / safe confusion / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with the same delegate address authorized on one Safe but not another Safe with similar recipients while another Safe has a similar delegate or recipient topology but no matching route and make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Protocol-facing unauthorized transfers that later harm another user or vault?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: the same delegate address authorized on one Safe but not another Safe with similar recipients
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol-facing unauthorized transfers that later harm another user or vault
- Fast validation: Check that neighboring recipients, collections, or tokens cannot be reached through a superficially similar approved route.
