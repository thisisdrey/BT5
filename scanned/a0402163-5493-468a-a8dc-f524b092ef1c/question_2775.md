# Q2775: Vault NAV freshness and cross-contract state: cashflow withdrawal timing / stale ledger / one state one price

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower, investor, buyer, seller, or shareholder interacting through ordinary protocol entrypoints enter through `Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals` with ordinary investor-withdraw or cashflow-collection timing around a vault-held position while deposit or redemption approvals are about to rely on `_requireFreshNav` and make a user-controlled entitlement or cashflow change create a price-sensitive stale-state window across approvals, breaking the rule that the same real economic state should map to one consistent approval-time price regardless of user-controlled timing and leading to Protocol state bricking or repeated approval blockage if freshness invalidation can be bypassed or inconsistently triggered?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / _requireFreshNav, updateNav, collectCashflows, fundLoans, createSaleOffer, acceptSaleOffer
- Entrypoint: Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals
- Attacker controls: ordinary investor-withdraw or cashflow-collection timing around a vault-held position
- Exploit idea: make a user-controlled entitlement or cashflow change create a price-sensitive stale-state window across approvals
- Invariant to test: the same real economic state should map to one consistent approval-time price regardless of user-controlled timing
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol state bricking or repeated approval blockage if freshness invalidation can be bypassed or inconsistently triggered
- Fast validation: Check that ordinary user timing cannot create underbacked or overbacked claims for other shareholders.
