# Q2500: Vault async redeem flow: share batching / ratio drift / no stranded redeem

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with share amounts chosen to maximize rounding boundaries across several approvals while the manager approves redemptions while `lastNav` is fresh and `navStart` is idle and make claimableRedeemShares and claimableRedeemAssets decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable redemption value and leading to Cross-shareholder dilution through broken async redemption accounting?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: share amounts chosen to maximize rounding boundaries across several approvals
- Exploit idea: make claimableRedeemShares and claimableRedeemAssets decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable redemption value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-shareholder dilution through broken async redemption accounting
- Fast validation: Model a tight-liquidity approval followed by partial claims and assert no controller can extract more than the burned shares justified.
