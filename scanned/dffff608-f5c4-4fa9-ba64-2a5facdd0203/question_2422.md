# Q2422: calc-treasury-lp-preview via supply-collateral-add: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow, so the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
