# Q3019: receipt-to-transaction backfill consistency — v3.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`, receipts whose originating transaction hash is attacker-influenced, when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit, and additionally when the pool is filled exactly to its bound by many attacker keys, reach `resolve_to_current_shard` in `core/primitives/src/shard_layout/v3.rs` and break the receipt-to-transaction mapping so outcomes are attributed to the wrong transaction, breaking the invariant that every receipt maps to exactly one originating transaction, leading to High - Unintended chain split (network partition)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/shard_layout/v3.rs` :: `resolve_to_current_shard`
- Entrypoint: an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`
- Attacker controls: receipts whose originating transaction hash is attacker-influenced; when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit; when the pool is filled exactly to its bound by many attacker keys
- Exploit idea: break the receipt-to-transaction mapping so outcomes are attributed to the wrong transaction
- Invariant to test: every receipt maps to exactly one originating transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Unintended chain split (network partition)
- Fast validation: test asserting the mapping over crafted receipt chains
