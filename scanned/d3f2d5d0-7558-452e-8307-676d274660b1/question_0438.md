# Q0438: parse_gre_tunnel_info_from_linkinfo can persist state that blocks later replay (netlink.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `parse_gre_tunnel_info_from_linkinfo` in `xdp/src/netlink.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and commit state through `parse_gre_tunnel_info_from_linkinfo` that a later load or restart refuses to accept, so that the invariant "Any state this path can commit is loadable by the same version on restart." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `xdp/src/netlink.rs` -> `parse_gre_tunnel_info_from_linkinfo()` (around line 498)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Commit account/ledger state through `parse_gre_tunnel_info_from_linkinfo` that a later load rejects, so every node fails replay after restart and needs manual intervention.
- Invariant to test: Any state this path can commit is loadable by the same version on restart.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Write the crafted state, restart the bank from it in a test, and assert replay completes.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged remote client can send TPU/QUIC traffic or transaction packets that panic, deadlock, or unboundedly grow memory in ingress, sigverify, scheduling, or PoH, halting block production across the cluster.
