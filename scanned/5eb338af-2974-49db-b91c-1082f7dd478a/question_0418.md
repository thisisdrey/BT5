# Q0418: Loans funding and disbursement state: fresh owner / wrong investor pull / exact commitment

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a loan NFT that the attacker just acquired through a normal transfer or exchange settlement while the NFT has been approved, listed, cancelled, or transferred shortly before the funding call and make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan, breaking the rule that the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan and leading to Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a loan NFT that the attacker just acquired through a normal transfer or exchange settlement
- Exploit idea: make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan
- Invariant to test: the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC
- Fast validation: Forge test ownership changes, lock cycles, and standing allowances around `fund`, then assert only the current NFT owner can move capital exactly once.
