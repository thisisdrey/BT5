# [H] Path traversal vulnerability in ocaml-tar

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: OSEC-2026-08
Aliases: CVE-2026-45390
Ecosystem: opam
CVSS: 8.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N)
Published: 2026-05-22
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/OSEC-2026-08
Type: osv

## Affected
- opam: `tar` — affected >=0 <3.5.0, >=0 <51ceb0a15982993503c169b9d84456fd50eabe99

## Details
A malicious archive with `../` path segments in its name allows escaping the current working directory. This is not desired behavior, and tar(1) rejects such extractions, but ocaml-tar decompresses it anyway.
The impact is that it allows arbitrary file write outside of the desired extraction directory to an attacker that can reach a tar decompression endpoint. In terms of severity, similar vulnerabilities in different ecosystems (python, node, go) have been assigned CVSS scores of 6.8 MEDIUM, 7.1 HIGH, and 8.2 HIGH.

## Details

Function `Tar_unix.extract` uses `Filename.concat`.

```OCaml
let extract ?(filter = fun _ -> true) ~src dst =
  let f ?global:_ hdr () =
    if filter hdr then
      match hdr.Tar.Header.link_indicator with
      | Tar.Header.Link.Normal ->
        begin match Result.map_error unix_err_to_msg
            (safe Unix.(openfile (Filename.concat dst hdr.Tar.Header.file_name)
                          [ O_WRONLY ; O_CREAT ]) hdr.Tar.Header.file_mode) with
        | Error _ as err -> Tar.return err
        | Ok dst ->
          try copy ~dst_fd:dst (Int64.to_int hdr.Tar.Header.file_size)
          with exn -> safe_close dst; Tar.return (Error (`Exn exn))
        end
        (* TODO set owner / mode / mtime etc. *)
      | _ ->
        (* TODO handle directories, links, etc. *)
        let open Tar.Syntax in
        let* () = Tar.seek (Int64.to_int hdr.Tar.Header.file_size) in
        Tar.return (Ok ())
    else
      let open Tar.Syntax in
      let* () = Tar.seek (Int64.to_int hdr.Tar.Header.file_size) in
      Tar.return (Ok ())
  in
  fold f src ()
```

`Filename.concat` does not perform any sanitation:

```
# Filename.concat "/tmp" "../../../etc/passwd";;
- : string = "/tmp/../../../etc/passwd"
```

Hence, calling `Unix.openfile` on such a path will result in opening `/etc/passwd`.

I only confirmed it in the following setting (see PoC below), and a proper fix would require investigating it in more details:

version targeted: 3.3.0, which seems to be the only version of ocaml-tar. But use of `Filename.concat` seems to have been there since the beginning.

## Impact

This is a path traversal vulnerability that allows an attacker to perform an arbitrary file write outside of the intended extraction directory.
Vulnerable users are the users relying on ocaml-tar, which includes (according to the readme of ocaml-tar):

- xapi (confirmed not vulnerable by maintainers)
- obuilder

Related CVEs

- CVE-2007-4559: same problem in python's implementation of tar
- CVE-2025-0377: similar problem in hashicorp's go implementation of tar
- CVE-2026-24842: similar problem in node-tar

## Fix

The fix is to sanitize paths before calling `Unix.openfile`. In the presence of symlink support, extra validation is needed.
