# [H] GitPython: Unguarded git option forwarding in IndexFile.checkout() and TagReference.create() enables arbitrary file overwrite and arbitrary file read

## Affected
- PyPI: `GitPython` — affected >=0 <3.1.57

## Details
**Target:** gitpython-developers/GitPython
**Tested:** HEAD `07e80555` (2026-07-25), latest release 3.1.55, `git version 2.50.1`
**Reported instances:** 2 exploitable, from a sweep of 14 unguarded call sites

## Summary

GitPython blocks dangerous git options through `Git.check_unsafe_options()`, gated per method by an `allow_unsafe_options` parameter. That guard is applied **per call site**, so any API that forwards `**kwargs` into a git command without calling it passes caller-controlled options straight to git.

A mechanical sweep of every method that forwards `**kwargs` into a `.git.<command>(...)` call found **14 sites with no guard**. Two reach a git option that takes a filesystem path:

| # | Call site | git option | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `IndexFile.checkout()` → `git checkout-index` | `--prefix=<path>` | arbitrary file **overwrite** with repository-controlled content |
| 2 | `TagReference.create()` → `git tag` | `-F <file>` / `--file=<file>` | arbitrary file **read**, returned in-band |

This is the same defect class already fixed in `Commit.count()` (GHSA-p538-c434-8v24), `Repo.archive()` and `Git.ls_remote()` (GHSA-956x-8gvw-wg5v). Both instances below are still present at HEAD.

---

## Instance 1 — `IndexFile.checkout()`: arbitrary file overwrite

`git/index/base.py:1210` accepts `**kwargs` and forwards them with no guard:

```python
def checkout(self, paths=None, force=False, fprogress=lambda *args: None, **kwargs):
    ...
    proc = self.repo.git.checkout_index(*args, **kwargs)   # line 1331
    ...
    proc = self.repo.git.checkout_index(args, **kwargs)    # line 1349
```

There is no `allow_unsafe_options` parameter and no `check_unsafe_options()` call in the method.

`git checkout-index` accepts `--prefix=<string>`, prepended to every output path. It is not confined to the working tree, so an absolute prefix writes tracked file contents anywhere the process can write, and `-f` overwrites what is already there.

### Reproduction

```python
from git import Repo
Repo("/path/to/repo").index.checkout(prefix="/tmp/target_dir/", a=True, f=True)
```

Observed (`poc/poc_checkout_index.py`) — no exception raised, files land outside the repository:

```
[ALLOWED] no UnsafeOptionError raised
files written outside the repo: ['f.txt']
  f.txt: 'hi\n'
```

Overwrite of a pre-existing file (`poc/poc_ci_overwrite.py`) — the victim file held `ORIGINAL-DO-NOT-CLOBBER\n` before the call:

```
[ALLOWED] no exception
victim content now: 'hi\n'
OVERWRITTEN: True
```

### Why this rates High

Both halves of the write are attacker-influenced:

- **Destination** — the `prefix` kwarg.
- **Content** — the bytes written are repository blobs, so anyone who can land a file in the repository (a pull-request branch, a mirrored or untrusted repository, an agent-cloned repository) controls exactly what is written.

Commit a file named `authorized_keys`, `.bashrc`, `config` or `post-checkout`, choose the matching prefix (`~/.ssh/`, `~/`, `.git/hooks/`), and the write becomes code execution as the service account.

For comparison within this project: GHSA-fjr4-x663-mwxc (arbitrary file overwrite via `git diff --output`) is rated High, and GHSA-p538-c434-8v24 (arbitrary file *truncation* via `git rev-list --output`) is rated Medium. `--prefix` supplies full content control, so it sits at or above the former.

---

## Instance 2 — `TagReference.create()`: arbitrary file read

`git/refs/tag.py:88` forwards `**kwargs` into `git tag` with no guard, and the signature advertises the passthrough:

```python
def create(cls, repo, path, reference="HEAD", logmsg=None, force=False, **kwargs):
    """...
    :param kwargs:
        Additional keyword arguments to be passed to :manpage:`git-tag(1)`.
    """
```

`git tag` accepts `-F <file>` / `--file=<file>`, which reads the tag message from an arbitrary path. The annotated tag object stores that content and GitPython returns it to the caller via `TagReference.tag.message`, so the file contents come back in-band.

### Reproduction

```python
from git import Repo
from git.refs.tag import TagReference

t = TagReference.create(Repo("/path/to/repo"), "x", force=True, a=True, F="/etc/passwd")
print(t.tag.message)
```

Observed (`poc/poc_tag_F.py`), reading a canary file outside the repository:

```
[ALLOWED] no UnsafeOptionError raised
>>> tag message recovered from arbitrary path: 'TAG-READ-CANARY-98765\nsecond-line-secret'
```

Impact is a read at the privileges of the process. I am not claiming code execution for this instance. The signing options (`-s`, `-u`/`--local-user`) do invoke gpg from the same unguarded kwargs, but I did not develop that into command execution and make no claim about it.

## Sweep results — the other 12 sites

Reported so the fix can be scoped once rather than per report. `poc/sweep.py` reproduces this list.

| Call site | git command | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| `IndexFile.from_tree()` | `read-tree` | `--index-output=<path>` looked reachable but is **neutralised**: GitPython appends its own `--index-output` after the caller's kwargs and git honours the last occurrence. Verified — victim file unchanged (`poc/poc_readtree.py`) |
| `IndexFile.remove()` | `rm` | `--pathspec-from-file` only reads a pathspec; no write or disclosure primitive found |
| `IndexFile.move()` | `mv` | same |
| `HEAD.reset()` | `reset` | same |
| `HEAD.checkout()` | `checkout` | same |
| `Head.delete()`, `RemoteReference.delete()` | `branch` | no path-taking option found |
| `Repo.merge_base()` | `merge-base` | no path-taking option found |
| `Repo._get_untracked_files()` | `status` | no path-taking option found |
| `Remote.set_url()`, `Remote.create()`, `Remote.update()` | `remote` | URL handling already addressed by GHSA-94p4-4cq8-9g67 |

## Suggested remediation

**Immediate:** add `allow_unsafe_options: bool = False` to both methods and gate `Git._option_candidates(args, kwargs)` against new lists — `unsafe_git_checkout_index_options = ["--prefix"]` (consider `--temp`) and `unsafe_git_tag_options = ["--file", "-F"]` (consider `-s`, `-u`/`--local-user`, `--cleanup`) — matching the pattern used in `Repo.archive()` and `Commit.count()`.

**Structural:** this defect has now been fixed four times in four places (`Repo.archive()`, `Git.ls_remote()`, `Commit.count()`, and the two here), because the guard is opt-in per method: every new `**kwargs`-forwarding API starts unguarded and stays that way until someone reports it. Enforcing the check centrally in `Git._call_process()` — each git invocation consults a per-command unsafe-option table unless the caller opts out — would make new call sites safe by default rather than by review, and would close the remaining sites in the table above at the same time.
