# Q2435: promise_yield data-id collision — receipt.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM calling `promise_yield_create` / `promise_yield_resume`, two yields whose data ids are derived from attacker-chosen inputs that collide, when combined with a DeployContract earlier in the same action list, reach `output_data_receivers` in `core/primitives/src/receipt.rs` and resume another contract's yielded promise with attacker-supplied payload, breaking the invariant that yield data ids are unforgeable and bound to the creating receipt, leading to High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/receipt.rs` :: `output_data_receivers`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM calling `promise_yield_create` / `promise_yield_resume`
- Attacker controls: two yields whose data ids are derived from attacker-chosen inputs that collide; when combined with a DeployContract earlier in the same action list
- Exploit idea: resume another contract's yielded promise with attacker-supplied payload
- Invariant to test: yield data ids are unforgeable and bound to the creating receipt
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass
- Fast validation: unit test on data-id derivation asserting unforgeability
