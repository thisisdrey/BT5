# Q2886: get-liquidation-position via supply-collateral-add: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-liquidation-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against, so the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473` -> `get-liquidation-position`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `get-liquidation-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
