# Q4882: relevant via collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
