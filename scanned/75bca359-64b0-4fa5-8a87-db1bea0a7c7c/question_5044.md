# Q5044: Stake/unstake in the same action list — adapter.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a single transaction batching many actions against an attacker-owned receiver, Stake(x) followed by Stake(0) in one list, repeated across blocks at epoch boundaries, when combined with a DeleteAccount later in the same action list, and additionally when the receiver account already exists with balance and keys, reach `view_account` in `runtime/runtime/src/adapter.rs` and leave balance permanently locked or double-unlocked across the epoch transition, breaking the invariant that unstaked balance becomes withdrawable exactly once, after the protocol unlock delay, leading to Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/runtime/src/adapter.rs` :: `view_account`
- Entrypoint: a single transaction batching many actions against an attacker-owned receiver
- Attacker controls: Stake(x) followed by Stake(0) in one list, repeated across blocks at epoch boundaries; when combined with a DeleteAccount later in the same action list; when the receiver account already exists with balance and keys
- Exploit idea: leave balance permanently locked or double-unlocked across the epoch transition
- Invariant to test: unstaked balance becomes withdrawable exactly once, after the protocol unlock delay
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)
- Fast validation: test-loop test running stake/unstake across an epoch boundary
