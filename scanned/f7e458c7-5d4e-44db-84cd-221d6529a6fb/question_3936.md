# Q3936: unpack-u16 via supply-collateral-add: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position state the final collateral-add is validated against across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `unpack-u16` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
