# Q3786: linear-interpolate via redeem: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, so the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `redeem` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `linear-interpolate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
