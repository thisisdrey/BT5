# [H] ath10k: skip ath10k_halt during suspend for driver state RESTARTING

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2022-49519
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2025-02-26
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2022-49519
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=4.10.0 <5.10.121, >=5.11.0 <5.15.46, >=5.16.0 <5.17.14, >=5.18.0 <5.18.3

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ath10k: skip ath10k_halt during suspend for driver state RESTARTING

Double free crash is observed when FW recovery(caused by wmi
timeout/crash) is followed by immediate suspend event. The FW recovery
is triggered by ath10k_core_restart() which calls driver clean up via
ath10k_halt(). When the suspend event occurs between the FW recovery,
the restart worker thread is put into frozen state until suspend completes.
The suspend event triggers ath10k_stop() which again triggers ath10k_halt()
The double invocation of ath10k_halt() causes ath10k_htt_rx_free() to be
called twice(Note: ath10k_htt_rx_alloc was not called by restart worker
thread because of its frozen state), causing the crash.

To fix this, during the suspend flow, skip call to ath10k_halt() in
ath10k_stop() when the current driver state is ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING.
Also, for driver state ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING, call
ath10k_wait_for_suspend() in ath10k_stop(). This is because call to
ath10k_wait_for_suspend() is skipped later in
[ath10k_halt() > ath10k_core_stop()] for the driver state
ATH10K_STATE_RESTARTING.

The frozen restart worker thread will be cancelled during resume when the
device comes out of suspend.
