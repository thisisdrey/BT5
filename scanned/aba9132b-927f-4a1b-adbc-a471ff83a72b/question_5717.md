# Q5717: increment via liquidate-redeem: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) — which advances the user-id nonce — to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, breaking the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the redemption receiver, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
