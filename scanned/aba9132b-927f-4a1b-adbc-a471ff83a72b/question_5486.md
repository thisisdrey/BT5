# Q5486: calc-index-next via accrue: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `accrue` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block varied, and assert that the value `calc-index-next` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
