# Q1867: interest-rate via repay: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
`interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, use that to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `repay` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, then read `interest-rate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
