# Q4526: iter-find-superset via liquidate: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match, so the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267` -> `iter-find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering varied, and assert that the value `iter-find-superset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
