# Q3164: oracle-timestamp-fresh via supply-collateral-add: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) reach `oracle-timestamp-fresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:365) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it sets `delta` to u0 whenever `ts` exceeds `stacks-block-time`, so a future timestamp is maximally fresh, then requires `(>= ts prev)`, the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:365` -> `oracle-timestamp-fresh`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `oracle-timestamp-fresh` sets `delta` to u0 whenever `ts` exceeds `stacks-block-time`, so a future timestamp is maximally fresh, then requires `(>= ts prev)`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) varied, and assert that the value `oracle-timestamp-fresh` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
