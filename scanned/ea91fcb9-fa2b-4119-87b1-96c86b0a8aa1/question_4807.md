# Q4807: calc-treasury-lp-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, then read `calc-treasury-lp-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
