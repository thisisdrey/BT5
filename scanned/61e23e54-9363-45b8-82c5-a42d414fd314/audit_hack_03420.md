## Details
# Malicious Bull can make the Bear pay a very high gas fee by manipulating the NFT receive function

## Summary

The [settleContract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L374) function is used by the bear to sell his NFT to the bull and receive the bull's collateral and his premium. The Bull can make his NFT receive function such that, the Bear will use up the entire gas limit of the block and ends up wasting a large amount of ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail

Looking at the `settleContract` implementation, specifically where the [NFT is sent to bull](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L394-L400):

```solidity
        try IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, bull, tokenId) {}
        catch (bytes memory) {
            // Transfer NFT to BvbProtocol
            IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, address(this), tokenId);
            // Store that the bull has to retrieve it
            withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId] = bull;
        }
```

If the Bull simply reverts, it will not damage the functionality of the `settleContract` function or the Bear. But if the Bull increases the gas usage of his receive function, the Bear will be forced to pay it. As no limit of gas is specified in the `safeTransferFrom` call. 

A POC was written to prove this point. The following output was emitted during the test.

```

In the first test, the `maliciousBull1`  simply reverts and it doesnt affect the Bear in anyway. 

In the second test, the `maliciousBull2`  has a gas wasting operation, which uses up more than 30 million gas, which is the `gas limit` for a Block in Ethereum. 
```solidity
//gas wasting operation in maliciousBull2 contract
    function onERC721Received(
        address,
        address,
        uint256,
        bytes calldata
    ) external virtual returns (bytes4) {
        if (shouldBlockTransfer) {
            //use a lot of gas so that txn reverts
            for(uint i=0; i < 5000 ; i++) {  //this is enough to make sure the 30 million gas limit is breached
                blockTxn = i%2;  //storage writes
            } 
        }
        return BvbMaliciousBull2.onERC721Received.selector;
    }
```

Once the gas limit is reached, the call will revert, which means the code execution will start at the `catch` block and send the nft to the `BvbProtocol` contract.

## Impact

If the malicious Bull does manipulate his contract in such a way mentioned in the POC, the Bear is left with two options:
1. If the `premium`  and `collateral` is more valuable then the gas spent on `settleContract` and `loss on NFT`, then settle the contract anyway.
2. Otherwise ignore the Order, and just forget his `premium`. The Bull benefits in such a case as both the `premium`  and `collateral` will go to him.

## Recommendation

Limit the amount of gas sent for the `safeTransferFrom` call at [line 394](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L394). This is where the contract tries to transfer the NFT to the bull.
