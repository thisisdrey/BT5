# Q5484: deterministic account init combined with an implicit account transfer — memtries.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `DeterministicStateInit` / `UniversalStateInit` action creating an attacker-controlled account, a DeterministicStateInit for an id that a concurrent Transfer is also creating implicitly, when links are saturated across the exact resharding block, and additionally when the interaction crosses a protocol-version upgrade with receipts in flight, reach `get_root` in `core/store/src/trie/mem/memtries.rs` and have two creation paths race so one overwrites the other's state or keys, breaking the invariant that exactly one creation path can initialise a given account id, leading to High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/trie/mem/memtries.rs` :: `get_root`
- Entrypoint: a `DeterministicStateInit` / `UniversalStateInit` action creating an attacker-controlled account
- Attacker controls: a DeterministicStateInit for an id that a concurrent Transfer is also creating implicitly; when links are saturated across the exact resharding block; when the interaction crosses a protocol-version upgrade with receipts in flight
- Exploit idea: have two creation paths race so one overwrites the other's state or keys
- Invariant to test: exactly one creation path can initialise a given account id
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass
- Fast validation: runtime test racing implicit creation against deterministic init
