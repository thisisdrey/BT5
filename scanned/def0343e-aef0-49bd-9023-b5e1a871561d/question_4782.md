# Q4782: outgoing metadata group boundaries — bandwidth_scheduler.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`, a stream of receipts sized to create a maximal number of metadata groups, when the shard is driven exactly onto a congestion threshold, and additionally when the shard oscillates across the congestion threshold every block, reach `get_bit` in `core/primitives/src/bandwidth_scheduler.rs` and make metadata group bookkeeping lose or double-count queued bytes, breaking the invariant that outgoing metadata always reflects the exact bytes and count in the buffer, leading to Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/bandwidth_scheduler.rs` :: `get_bit`
- Entrypoint: an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`
- Attacker controls: a stream of receipts sized to create a maximal number of metadata groups; when the shard is driven exactly onto a congestion threshold; when the shard oscillates across the congestion threshold every block
- Exploit idea: make metadata group bookkeeping lose or double-count queued bytes
- Invariant to test: outgoing metadata always reflects the exact bytes and count in the buffer
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)
- Fast validation: store test asserting metadata equals a full buffer scan
