# Q3000: register system size accounting — context.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM calling the host function directly inside a `FunctionCall`, writes into registers at exactly max_register_size and a register count at max_number_registers, with the input length at exactly the host function's accepted maximum, and additionally with the input length one byte past the accepted maximum, reach `make_gas_counter` in `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/logic/context.rs` and exceed the register memory ceiling, or make the accounted size differ from the bytes actually held, breaking the invariant that total register memory is bounded and accounted exactly, leading to High - Temporary freezing of network transactions (chunk/block production delayed 500%+ over recent average)?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/logic/context.rs` :: `make_gas_counter`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM calling the host function directly inside a `FunctionCall`
- Attacker controls: writes into registers at exactly max_register_size and a register count at max_number_registers; with the input length at exactly the host function's accepted maximum; with the input length one byte past the accepted maximum
- Exploit idea: exceed the register memory ceiling, or make the accounted size differ from the bytes actually held
- Invariant to test: total register memory is bounded and accounted exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of network transactions (chunk/block production delayed 500%+ over recent average)
- Fast validation: unit test filling registers to the configured bounds
