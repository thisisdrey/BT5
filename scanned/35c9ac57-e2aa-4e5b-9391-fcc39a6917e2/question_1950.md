# Q1950: Vault async deposit flow: split parties / counter divergence / pending sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses while the manager approves only part of the pending assets before later approvals and make totalPendingDepositAssets or the per-controller claimable counters diverge from what the vault actually owes, breaking the rule that totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers and leading to User funds stuck because approved deposits become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: make totalPendingDepositAssets or the per-controller claimable counters diverge from what the vault actually owes
- Invariant to test: totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved deposits become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Simulate partial approvals across time and assert claimable assets and shares can always be fully exhausted without dust-locking value.
