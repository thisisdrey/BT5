# Q875: initialize: account-state transition skips a mandatory precondition [init-plus-a-later-transfer] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `initialize_account` with init plus a later transfer-account path in the same investigation so `initialize` performs a state transition without validating a required precondition, breaking `new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context` and causing `High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `initialize`
- Entrypoint: `initialize_account`
- Attacker controls: init plus a later transfer-account path in the same investigation
- Exploit idea: Focus on initialize/close/freeze/sync transitions where one branch may skip a check that sibling branches enforce. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze
- Fast validation: Hit the suspect branch directly in a test and assert it rejects the same invalid pre-state that other equivalent branches reject. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
