# Q1781: Exchange offer lifecycle: relist cycle / lock residue / one live offer state

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled cancellation and re-listing cycles for the same loans while one side is a vault or later counterparty that relies on precise lock cleanup and delivery semantics and make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone, breaking the rule that an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan and leading to Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled cancellation and re-listing cycles for the same loans
- Exploit idea: make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone
- Invariant to test: an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer
- Fast validation: Forge test directed offers with multiple loans, expiry edges, and registration churn, then assert full delivery or full revert.
