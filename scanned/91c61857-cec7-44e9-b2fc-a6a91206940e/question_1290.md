# Q1290: remove_proxy can bypass call filtering through wrapping

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `remove_proxy` to wrap, hash, preannounce, or proxy a call such that the effective nested call escapes the filter that should have applied to it?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/proxy/src/lib.rs::remove_proxy
- Entrypoint: public dispatch wrapper `remove_proxy`
- Attacker controls: nested call payloads, beneficiary, delegate, or target accounts, batched or wrapped execution context
- Exploit idea: Probe encoded-call hashing, batch nesting, fallback paths, and cross-wrapper composition.
- Invariant to test: Any nested call executed via the wrapper must satisfy the exact same filter and delay semantics as if it were checked at the final execution point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized account or call control leading to fund theft or governance capture
- Fast validation: Try the most privileged nested call still user-reachable and wrap it through every supported composition route.
