# [M] CVE-2026-48682

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-48682
CVSS: 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
Published: 2026-06-02
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-48682
Type: osv

## Details
FastNetMon Community Edition through 1.2.9 contains an out-of-bounds read in the IPv4 packet parser. In src/simple_packet_parser_ng.cpp, after validating that the packet contains at least sizeof(ipv4_header_t) bytes (20 bytes), the code advances the local_pointer by '4 * ipv4_header->get_ihl()' (line 164) without validating that (a) IHL >= 5 (the minimum valid value per RFC 791), or (b) 4 * IHL bytes are actually available in the packet. The IHL field is 4 bits, allowing values 0-15, so the advance can be 0-60 bytes. An IHL value of 15 with only 20 bytes validated causes a 40-byte over-read. An IHL of 0-4 causes the pointer to not advance past the IP header, resulting in the TCP/UDP header being parsed from IP header data (type confusion). This vulnerability is reachable via any packet capture interface.
