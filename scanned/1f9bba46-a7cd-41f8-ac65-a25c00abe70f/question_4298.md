# Q4298: system-repay via borrow: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `borrow` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let varied, and assert that the value `system-repay` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
