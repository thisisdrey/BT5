# Vulnerability details

### Proof of Concept

1. Context 

In `swap_2_internal`, if the first pool doesn't have enough liquidity, `amount_in`could be less than `original_amount`, and as expected, `amount_in` is taken from swapper. But the function still refunds `original_amount - amount_in` to the user if `original_amount` is more than `amount_in`.

2. Bug Location
 
From the function, we can see than `amount_in` is taken from swapper. Then the function checks if `original_amount` is more than `amount_in`, before which the difference is transferred back to the sender.
```rs
>>      erc20::take(from, amount_in, permit2)?;
        erc20::transfer_to_sender(to, amount_out)?;

>>      if original_amount > amount_in {
            erc20::transfer_to_sender(
                to,
                original_amount
>>                  .checked_sub(amount_in)
                    .ok_or(Error::TransferToSenderSub)?,
            )?;
        }
```
 
3. Final Effect
 
An unnecessary refund is processed leading to loss of funds for the protocol. Malicious users can take advantage of this to "rob" the protocol of funds through the refunds.


### Recommended Mitigation Steps

No need to process refunds since `amount_in` is already taken.
