# [M] Centralization vulnerabilities are present in the protocol

## Details
The owner of BatonLaunchpad has total control of the nftImplementation and feeRate storage variable values in the contract. This opens up some attack vectors:
1. The owner of BatonLaunchpad can front-run a create call to change the nftImplementation contract to one that also has a method with which he can withdraw the mint fees from it, resulting in a "rug pull"
2. The owner of BatonLaunchpad can change the fee to a much higher value, either forcing the Nft minters to pay a huge fee or just to make them not want to mint any tokens.
3. The owner of the Caviar dependency can call close on the Pair contract, meaning that the nftAdd call in lockLp and the wrap call in seedYieldFarm would revert. This can mean that the locking of LP and the seeding of the yield farm can never complete, meaning the owner of the Nft contract can never call withdraw, leading to stuck ETH in the contract.

## Recommendation
Make the nftImplementation method callable only once, so the value can't be updated after initially set. For the feeRate add a MAX_FEE_RATE constant value and check that the new value is less than or equal to it. For the Caviar dependency issue you can call it with try-catch and just complete the locking of LP or seeding of the yield farm if the call throws an error.
