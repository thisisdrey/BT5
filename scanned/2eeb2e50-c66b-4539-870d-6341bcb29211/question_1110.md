# Q1110: Investor withdrawal routing: lock churn / double claim / single claim per payable

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set while the first loan in the batch is locked and fixes the recipient as the active unlocker and make one payable balance claimable in two ownership or lock epochs, breaking the rule that each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs and leading to Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set
- Exploit idea: make one payable balance claimable in two ownership or lock epochs
- Invariant to test: each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party
- Fast validation: Model sale-offer settlement or cancellation around `investorWithdraw` and assert no stale unlocker or stale owner can claim old payables.
