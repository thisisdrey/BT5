# Q2009: Vault async deposit flow: operator timing / price-lock break / proportional decay

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with an operator approval added and removed around request and claim boundaries while the manager approves only part of the pending assets before later approvals and make the shares claimed exceed the approval-time price lock for the same controller, breaking the rule that claimableDepositAssets[controller] and claimableDepositShares[controller] should decay proportionally to the actual claim and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess vault-share minting?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: an operator approval added and removed around request and claim boundaries
- Exploit idea: make the shares claimed exceed the approval-time price lock for the same controller
- Invariant to test: claimableDepositAssets[controller] and claimableDepositShares[controller] should decay proportionally to the actual claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess vault-share minting
- Fast validation: Assert that direct operator churn around request and claim never changes who can consume a controller's approved value.
