# Q5739: filter-u128 via borrow: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`filter-u128` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97) filters a 128-entry bucket list. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97` -> `filter-u128`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list. Reach it through `borrow` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `filter-u128` touches, run `borrow` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
