# [H] cheqd-node subject to Cosmos SDK "Barberry" vulnerability

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-8qxh-2gh8-r923
Ecosystem: Go
Published: 2023-06-12
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8qxh-2gh8-r923
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node` — affected >=0 <1.4.4

## Details
### Impact
This [vulnerability dubbed "Barberry" affects the Cosmos SDK framework](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-sdk-security-advisory-barberry/10825) used by `cheqd-node` as base.

It impacts the way Cosmos SDK handles vesting accounts, and can therefore be a high-impact vulnerability for any network running the framework.

There is no vulnerability in the DID/resource modules for `cheqd-node`.

### Patches
Node operators are requested to upgrade to [cheqd-node v1.4.4](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v1.4.4). This is not a state-breaking release and does not require a coordinated upgrade across all node operators.

This vulnerability was patched in [Cosmos SDK v0.46.13](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.13). Since this version switches to Go v1.19 and also changes the namespace of many Cosmos protobuf packages, the Barberry fix was [backported to cheqd's fork of Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cheqd/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.10-barberry).

### Mitigation
When at least ~**33**% of the voting power of the network has deployed the recommended version of the software, any attack would be unsuccessful but cause a chain halt.

Once at least ~**67**% of the voting power of the network has deployed recommended version of the software, the attack would be unsuccessful _without_ a chain halt.

### Workarounds
No. Node operators are recommended to upgrade to the latest release version.
