# Q5352: mask-shift-combine via liquidate: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `mask-shift-combine` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422` -> `mask-shift-combine`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `mask-shift-combine` folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `mask-shift-combine` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
