# Q4002: resolve-pyth via collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position's existing collateral and debt composition across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `resolve-pyth` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
