# Q0077: calc-liq-debt-repay-real via liquidate: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, drive `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733) — which re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)` — to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, breaking the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay-real`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
