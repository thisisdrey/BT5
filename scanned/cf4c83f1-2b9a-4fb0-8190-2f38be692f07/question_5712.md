# Q5712: collateral-remove via transfer: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `transfer` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `collateral-remove` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
