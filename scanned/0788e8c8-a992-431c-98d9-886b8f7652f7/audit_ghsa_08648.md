# [H] GoBGP has a panic in AdjRib.Update via malformed BGP Update message (Nil Pointer Dereference)

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-p3w2-64xm-833j
CVE: CVE-2026-42285
CWE: CWE-476
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-05-05

Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/osrg/gobgp/v4` — affected >=4.4.0 <4.5.0

## Details
### Summary
Remote Denial of Service (DoS) via Nil Pointer Dereference in BGP Update Processing
An unauthenticated remote BGP peer can trigger a fatal panic in GoBGP by sending a specially crafted BGP UPDATE message. When the server receives a message with inconsistent attribute lengths, it improperly handles the internal state transition to a "withdraw" action, leading to a nil pointer dereference in the AdjRib.Update function. This causes the entire GoBGP process to crash, resulting in a complete loss of service availability.


### Details
The vulnerability originates in the interaction between the BGP message decoding logic and the Adj-RIB table management.

Triggering Condition: When a BGP UPDATE message contains attributes that fail validation (e.g., "attribute value length is short"), GoBGP logs a warning: the received Update message was treated as withdraw.

Code Path:

The message reaches github.com/osrg/gobgp/v4/pkg/server.(*peer).handleUpdate.

Due to the malformed attributes, the message is processed as a withdrawal, but the internal representation of the path or its attributes becomes nil.

The execution flows to internal/pkg/table/adj.go:127 within (*AdjRib).Update.

The Flaw: At line 127 in adj.go, the code attempts to access a member of a structure (likely the path or a specific attribute container) that is nil due to the previous validation failure.
