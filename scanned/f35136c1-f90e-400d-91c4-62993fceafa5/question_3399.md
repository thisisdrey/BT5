# Q3399: add-user-collateral via repay: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
`add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, use that to make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree, violating the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `repay` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `add-user-collateral` touches, run `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
