# Q5339: vault-accrue via redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
