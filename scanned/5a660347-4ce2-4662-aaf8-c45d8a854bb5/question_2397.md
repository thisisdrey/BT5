# Q2397: withdraw - gas starvation of the resolver callback (10)

## Question
Given the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through the return value of the attacker's own FT/MT/receiver contract, fed into the `#[private]` resolve callback, choose `min_gas` / `state_init` / batch size at the entrypoint so the `DO_FT_WITHDRAW_GAS` callback in `contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/nep141/withdraw.rs` runs out of gas after the debit, leaving the balance burned with no refund, breaking the invariant `the resolver callback always executes with enough gas to restore the debited balance` and leading to permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/nep141/withdraw.rs](contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/nep141/withdraw.rs) - `DO_FT_WITHDRAW_GAS` (cross-check `ft_withdraw` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: the return value of the attacker's own FT/MT/receiver contract, fed into the `#[private]` resolve callback
- Attacker controls: the exact JSON the callee returns, whether it panics, and how much gas it burns
- Exploit idea: The floors (`FT_TRANSFER_CALL_GAS_MIN`, `MT_BATCH_TRANSFER_GAS_MIN`, `AuthCall::MIN_GAS_DEFAULT`, `STATE_INIT_GAS`) plus `with_unused_gas_weight(0)` are the only protection; probe whether a caller-chosen value passes the floor but starves the resolve step. Set-up: the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value.
- Invariant to test: the resolver callback always executes with enough gas to restore the debited balance
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)
- Fast validation: Sweep `min_gas` and token-count values; assert the resolver completes for every value the entrypoint accepts.
