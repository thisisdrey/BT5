# Q5676: convert-to-scaled-debt via liquidate: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `convert-to-scaled-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
