# Q5026: calculate-asset-notional-value via collateral-add: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, can an unprivileged attacker make `calculate-asset-notional-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544` -> `calculate-asset-notional-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
