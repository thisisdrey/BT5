# Q0900: population via liquidate: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it counts set bits to order the bucket search, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `population` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
