# Q5575: iter-lookup-collateral via liquidate: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `liquidate` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `iter-lookup-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
