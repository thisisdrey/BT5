# Q1924: map_account can create persistent public VM griefing

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `map_account` to keep the runtime doing underpriced heavy VM or host work repeatedly enough to degrade block production?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/revive/src/lib.rs::map_account
- Entrypoint: public VM / contract execution extrinsic `map_account`
- Attacker controls: call repetition, batching order, and surrounding state
- Exploit idea: Search for public execution shapes that maximize real work per charged unit or preserve expensive cleanup for later blocks.
- Invariant to test: Worst-case public VM work must remain within charged weight and must not create a repeatable block-slowdown path.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Chain halt / block-production slowdown from undercharged VM execution
- Fast validation: Fuzz maximal code size, call depth, revert depth, storage growth, and repeated cleanup patterns.
