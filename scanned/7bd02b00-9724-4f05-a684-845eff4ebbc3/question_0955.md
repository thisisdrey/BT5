# Q0955: trap classification determinism — runner.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `DeployContract` action carrying attacker-authored WASM, modules that trap via stack exhaustion, unreachable, and integer division by zero, with function, local, table, and nesting limits all at their exact maxima, reach `runtime` in `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/runner.rs` and have the same trap classified as different error variants across runs or platforms, breaking the invariant that trap classification maps to one deterministic protocol error per trap cause, leading to Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/runner.rs` :: `runtime`
- Entrypoint: a `DeployContract` action carrying attacker-authored WASM
- Attacker controls: modules that trap via stack exhaustion, unreachable, and integer division by zero; with function, local, table, and nesting limits all at their exact maxima
- Exploit idea: have the same trap classified as different error variants across runs or platforms
- Invariant to test: trap classification maps to one deterministic protocol error per trap cause
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork
- Fast validation: differential test classifying each trap kind repeatedly
