## Details
The extendLoan function in DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan has redundant time calculation logic that causes transaction reversions when borrowers attempt to extend loans near their deadline.  
In the DebitaV3Loan contract the function extendLoan function has a varaible extendedTime that is not used and can cause reverts in some cases which cause some borrowers to not be able to extend their loan.  
The exact line of code:  
ontracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L590  

Internal pre-conditions  
1. Loan must not be already extended (extended == false)  
2. Borrower must have waited minimum duration (10% of initial duration)  
3. Loan must not be expired (nextDeadline() > block.timestamp)  
4. Must have at least one unpaid offer  

External pre-conditions  
1. Current time must be close to offer's maxDeadline  
2. maxDeadline - (block.timestamp - startedAt) - block.timestamp < 0  

Attack Path  
1. Loan starts at timestamp 1704067200 (January 1, 2024)  
2. Time advances to 1705190400 (January 14, 2024)  
3. Borrower attempts to extend loan  
4. For an offer with maxDeadline 1705276800 (January 15, 2024)  
5. Transaction reverts due to arithmetic underflow  

Borrowers cannot extend loans near their deadlines even when they satisfy all other requirements:  
1. Forces unnecessary defaults near deadline  
2. Wastes gas on failed extension attempts  
3. Disrupts normal loan management operationsthe

## Proof of Concept
This PoC demonstrates the reversion caused by unused time calculations in extendLoan function.  
```solidity
contract BugPocTime {
    uint256 loanStartedAt = 1704067200; // 1 January 00:00 time
    uint256 currentTime = 1705190400; // 14 January 00:00 time
    uint256 maxDeadline = 1705276800; // 15 January 00:00 time

    function extendLoan() public view returns(uint256){
        uint256 alreadyUsedTime = currentTime - loanStartedAt;
        uint256 extendedTime = maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - currentTime;
        return 10;
    }
}
```

The example uses the following timestamps:  
1. loanStartedAt: 1704067200 (Jan 1, 2024 00:00)  
2. currentTime: 1705190400 (Jan 14, 2024 00:00)  
3. maxDeadline: 1705276800 (Jan 15, 2024 00:00)  

The calculation flow:  
1. alreadyUsedTime = 1705190400 - 1704067200 = 1,123,200 (≈13 days)  
2. extendedTime = 1705276800 - 1,123,200 - 1705190400 = 1705276800 - 1706313600 = -1,036,800 (reverts due to underflow)

## Recommendation
Remove the unused extendedTime calculation as it serves no purpose and can cause legitimate loan extensions to fail.
