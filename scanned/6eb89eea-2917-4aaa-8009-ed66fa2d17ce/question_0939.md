# Q0939: next-liquidity-index via repay: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `repay` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `next-liquidity-index` touches, run `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
