## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=6.4.0 <6.4.4

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Make bpf_refcount_acquire fallible for non-owning refs

This patch fixes an incorrect assumption made in the original
bpf_refcount series [0], specifically that the BPF program calling
bpf_refcount_acquire on some node can always guarantee that the node is
alive. In that series, the patch adding failure behavior to rbtree_add
and list_push_{front, back} breaks this assumption for non-owning
references.

Consider the following program:

  n = bpf_kptr_xchg(&mapval, NULL);
  /* skip error checking */

  bpf_spin_lock(&l);
  if(bpf_rbtree_add(&t, &n->rb, less)) {
    bpf_refcount_acquire(n);
    /* Failed to add, do something else with the node */
  }
  bpf_spin_unlock(&l);

It's incorrect to assume that bpf_refcount_acquire will always succeed in this
scenario. bpf_refcount_acquire is being called in a critical section
here, but the lock being held is associated with rbtree t, which isn't
necessarily the lock associated with the tree that the node is already
in. So after bpf_rbtree_add fails to add the node and calls bpf_obj_drop
in it, the program has no ownership of the node's lifetime. Therefore
the node's refcount can be decr'd to 0 at any time after the failing
rbtree_add. If this happens before the refcount_acquire above, the node
might be free'd, and regardless refcount_acquire will be incrementing a
0 refcount.

Later patches in the series exercise this scenario, resulting in the
expected complaint from the kernel (without this patch's changes):

  refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.

  (rest of output snipped)

The patch addresses this by changing bpf_refcount_acquire_impl to use
refcount_inc_not_zero instead of refcount_inc and marking
bpf_refcount_acquire KF_RET_NULL.

For owning references, though, we know the above scenario is not possible
and thus that bpf_refcount_acquire will always succeed. Some verifier
bookkeeping is added to track "is input owning ref?" for bpf_refcount_acquire
calls and return false from is_kfunc_ret_null for bpf_refcount_acquire on
owning refs despite it being marked KF_RET_NULL.

Existing selftests using bpf_refcount_acquire are modified where
necessary to NULL-check its return value.
