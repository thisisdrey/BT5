# Q1671: uint-to-list-u64 via borrow: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
`uint-to-list-u64` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80) expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80` -> `uint-to-list-u64`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `uint-to-list-u64` expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Reach it through `borrow` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `uint-to-list-u64` touches, run `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
