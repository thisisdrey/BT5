# Q1863: interpolate-rate via accrue: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
`interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, use that to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `accrue` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `interpolate-rate` touches, run `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
