# Q0562: Loans funding and disbursement state: role handoff / wrong investor pull / exact commitment

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call while a vault, buyer, or downstream counterparty could rely on the resulting balances after funding or disbursement and make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan, breaking the rule that the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call
- Exploit idea: make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan
- Invariant to test: the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing
- Fast validation: Assert that any failed disbursement or replay attempt reverts without leaving priceable or withdrawable balances behind.
