# Q3293: contract - nonce cleanup driven by an attacker's timing (25)

## Question
Given the request is replayed against a sibling subwallet deployment, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `w_execute_signed(msg: RequestMessage, proof: String)` - relayable by any account, call `Contract` in `contracts/wallet/signatures/no-sign/src/contract.rs` to force a nonce rotation at a moment that discards a victim's in-flight nonce, enabling replay of their signed request, breaking the invariant `a nonce is discarded only after every request that could carry it has expired` and leading to direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/wallet/signatures/no-sign/src/contract.rs](contracts/wallet/signatures/no-sign/src/contract.rs) - `Contract`
- Entrypoint: `w_execute_signed(msg: RequestMessage, proof: String)` - relayable by any account
- Attacker controls: the entire `RequestMessage` (chain_id, signer_id, nonce, deadline, ops) and the `proof` string
- Exploit idea: Rotation is time-driven and triggered by ordinary calls; probe whether an unprivileged caller can advance it early. Set-up: the request is replayed against a sibling subwallet deployment.
- Invariant to test: a nonce is discarded only after every request that could carry it has expired
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once
- Fast validation: Trigger rotation immediately before a victim's request lands; assert the request cannot execute twice.
