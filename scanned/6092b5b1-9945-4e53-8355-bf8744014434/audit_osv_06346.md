# [M] `HTTPPasswordMgr` can send saved HTTPS credentials via HTTP because of incorrect scheme matching

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: BIT-libpython-2026-15806
Aliases: BIT-python-2026-15806, BIT-python-min-2026-15806, CVE-2026-15806, PSF-2026-36
Ecosystem: Bitnami
Published: 2026-09-11

Type: osv

## Affected
- Bitnami: `libpython` — affected unspecified

## Details
The HTTPPasswordMgr class in the urllib.request module, along with its subclasses HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm and HTTPPasswordMgrWithPriorAuth, did not take the URL scheme into account when matching stored credentials against a requested URL. Credentials added for an https:// URL were also used for requests to the same host over http://, so an attacker able to redirect or downgrade a client to plain HTTP (for example, via an HTTPS-to-HTTP redirect or an on-path position) could capture credentials in cleartext. Credentials added for http:// URLs could likewise be sent over https://.

Credential matching is now scoped by URL scheme. Credentials registered with a URL that includes a scheme are only used for requests with the same scheme. Credentials registered with a bare authority (such as example.com or example.com:8080) continue to match any scheme, preserving compatibility with existing code, including proxy authentication.

Users who cannot upgrade immediately can mitigate by ensuring that applications never make plain http:// requests to hosts for which credentials are registered, for example by not following redirects to http:// URLs.
