# [C] efree() on uninitialized Heap data in imagescale leads to use-after-free

## Summary

CVE: CVE-2016-10166
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/478367

## Details
The core bug: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77269

This bugfix actually involves two vulnerabilities: a call to efree on uninitialized data and another free()  based vulnerability. What is described below is a bug that was fixed in libgd two years ago (CVE-2016-10166), but the patch was never applied to PHP's libgd. Furthermore, the patch for that CVE introduced a use after free vulnerability, also in PHPs `imagescale()` function. This can be seen in the comment history of the PHP bug.

----
The bug occurs in ext/gd/libgd/gd_interpolation.c in the function _gdContributionsAlloc(int line_size, int windows_size). The function will attempt to allocate helper structs and receives two parameters: the line size and the windows size. To prevent integer overflows, each parameter is passed to gd's overflow2() function before being used in the gdMalloc function.
(gdMalloc is just #define gdMalloc emalloc).

However, if the overflow2 check for windows size is positive, overflow_error is set to true, which leads to gd attempting to free all the lines allocated so far. The issue is that gd does not check if any lines have been allocated so far at all. By supplying input that leads to overflow2 being true, .Weights is freed, which is an unintialized pointer. 

```
if (overflow2(line_length, sizeof(ContributionType))) {
		gdFree(res);
		return NULL;
	}
	res->ContribRow = (ContributionType *) gdMalloc(line_length * sizeof(ContributionType));
	if (res->ContribRow == NULL) {
		gdFree(res);
		return NULL;
	}
	for (u = 0 ; u < line_length ; u++) {
		if (overflow2(windows_size, sizeof(double))) {
			overflow_error = 1;
		} else {
			res->ContribRow[u].Weights = (double *) gdMalloc(windows_size * sizeof(double));
		}
		if (overflow_error == 1 || res->ContribRow[u].Weights == NULL) {
			unsigned int i;
			u--;
			for (i=0;i<=u;i++) {
                gdFree(res->ContribRow[i].Weights);
			}
```

When the for loop is reached that frees the uninitialized pointers, i will be 0 and u too. However, before the for loop is entered u is decremented by one so it will turn into -1 , which leads to the condition i <=0 never being met.
