# [H] fbdev: fbcon: fix out-of-bounds read in err_out of fbcon_do_set_font()

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-53402
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2026-07-19
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-53402
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=0 <5.10.261, >=5.11.0 <5.15.212, >=5.16.0 <6.1.178, >=6.0.0 <6.6.145, >=6.2.0 <6.12.96, >=6.7.0 <6.18.39, >=6.13.0 <7.1.3

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: fbcon: fix out-of-bounds read in err_out of fbcon_do_set_font()

When fbcon_do_set_font() fails (e.g., due to a memory allocation failure
inside vc_resize() under heavy memory pressure), it jumps to the `err_out`
label to roll back the console state. However, the current rollback logic
forgets to restore the `hi_font` state, leading to a severe state machine
corruption.

Earlier in the function, `set_vc_hi_font()` might be called to change
`vc->vc_hi_font_mask` and mutate the screen buffer. If `vc_resize()`
subsequently fails, the `err_out` path restores `vc_font.charcount`
but entirely skips rolling back the `vc_hi_font_mask` and the screen
buffer.

This mismatch leaves the terminal in a desynchronized state. Because
`vc_hi_font_mask` remains set, the VT subsystem will still accept
character indices greater than 255 from userspace and write them to the
screen buffer. Subsequent rendering calls (e.g., `fbcon_putcs()`) will
then use these inflated indices to access the reverted, 256-character
font array, leading to a deterministic out-of-bounds read and potential
kernel memory disclosure.

Fix this by adding the missing rollback logic for the `hi_font` mask
and screen buffer in the error path.
