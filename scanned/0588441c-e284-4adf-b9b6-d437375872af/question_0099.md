# Q99: get_asset_shares: frozen or disabled account still reaches value-moving code [remaining-accounts-ordered-so-a] [cache-order]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker route `lending_account_deposit` through `get_asset_shares` with remaining accounts ordered so a second active bank context sits adjacent to the target bank so a frozen, disabled, or otherwise blocked account still changes value-bearing state, breaking `deposited assets must map to exactly one conservative internal share increase and never create withdrawable phantom value` and causing `Critical: direct theft or unauthorized withdrawal of protocol/user funds`? Focus specifically on whether one earlier public instruction in the same transaction can change a cache, flag, or active-balance view before settlement.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/bank.rs` / `get_asset_shares`
- Entrypoint: `lending_account_deposit`
- Attacker controls: remaining accounts ordered so a second active bank context sits adjacent to the target bank
- Exploit idea: Test whether authority/freeze/disabled checks are performed too late, on the wrong object, or on only part of the execution path. Focus specifically on whether one earlier public instruction in the same transaction can change a cache, flag, or active-balance view before settlement.
- Invariant to test: deposited assets must map to exactly one conservative internal share increase and never create withdrawable phantom value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: direct theft or unauthorized withdrawal of protocol/user funds
- Fast validation: Set the relevant flags, execute the controlled call, and assert that no vault transfer, share change, or balance activation occurs. Add an adversarial same-transaction precursor that changes dependent cache or balance state before the target call.
