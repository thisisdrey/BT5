# Q3124: Address-book role bit isolation: mutual whitelist / bit confusion / exact whitelist

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits while the canonical `address(this)` book and a self-managed book both contain related addresses and make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role, breaking the rule that loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book and leading to Unauthorized loan creation or exchange settlement path through role confusion?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits
- Exploit idea: make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role
- Invariant to test: loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized loan creation or exchange settlement path through role confusion
- Fast validation: Fuzz register/unregister churn across roles and ensure no stale authorization survives in create or exchange flows.
