# Q1021: Investor withdrawal routing: duplicate ids / stuck route / per-loan recipient

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with duplicate, reordered, or adversarially mixed loan ids in the batch while a vault, exchange, or later counterparty relies on the same payable balances after the batch and make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary, breaking the rule that every loan in investorWithdraw should pay only the recipient implied by that same loan's current owner and lock state and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: duplicate, reordered, or adversarially mixed loan ids in the batch
- Exploit idea: make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary
- Invariant to test: every loan in investorWithdraw should pay only the recipient implied by that same loan's current owner and lock state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers
- Fast validation: Forge test mixed locked/unlocked batches, duplicate ids, and ownership transfers, then assert each loan pays exactly one valid recipient once.
