# Q1967: min_slot charges far less than it costs (ancestors.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `min_slot` in `accounts-db/src/ancestors.rs` with a request that stays one unit under the limit but repeats within a single transaction, and make the real CPU/memory cost of `min_slot` exceed the units charged for it, so that the invariant "Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/ancestors.rs` -> `min_slot()` (around line 69)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a request that stays one unit under the limit but repeats within a single transaction
- Exploit idea: Find the input shape where `min_slot`'s real CPU/memory/IO cost grows much faster than the compute units or fee charged for it.
- Invariant to test: Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Measure real time/allocations versus units charged across input sizes; assert cost/CU ratio stays bounded.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply force sigverify, dedup, scheduling, or buffering work that vastly exceeds the fees ever collected, degrading the leader below true cost.
