# Q1128: Investor withdrawal routing: lock churn / double claim / no stale unlocker

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set while a sale offer was recently accepted or cancelled before the batch executes and make one payable balance claimable in two ownership or lock epochs, breaking the rule that a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch and leading to Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set
- Exploit idea: make one payable balance claimable in two ownership or lock epochs
- Invariant to test: a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows
- Fast validation: Forge test mixed locked/unlocked batches, duplicate ids, and ownership transfers, then assert each loan pays exactly one valid recipient once.
