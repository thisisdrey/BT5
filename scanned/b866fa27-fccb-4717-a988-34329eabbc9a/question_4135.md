# Q4135: remove-user-scaled-debt via liquidate: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`remove-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244) deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:244` -> `remove-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-scaled-debt` deletes the row only on an exact zero, otherwise leaving a residue that keeps the mask bit set. Reach it through `liquidate` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, then read `remove-user-scaled-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
