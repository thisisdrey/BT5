# Q3856: calc-index-next via collateral-add: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
