# Q5738: relevant via liquidate-multi: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch varied, and assert that the value `relevant` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
