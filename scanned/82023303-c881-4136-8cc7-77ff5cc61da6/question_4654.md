# Q4654: calc-liq-debt-repay via liquidate: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `debt-amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liq-debt-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `calc-liq-debt-repay` takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`, so the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay` takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
