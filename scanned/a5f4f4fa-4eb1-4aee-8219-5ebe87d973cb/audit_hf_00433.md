## Details
epoch with FLASHLOAN in a single transaction  
An attacker, with the aid of flash-loan can steal the entire borrow and lending incentives. This involves the attacker creating a huge lend offer with funds from flash-loan, creating a borrow offer with dust amount as collateral, self-matching the offer, paying back the loan in the same block(with zero interest) and having extra principle to payback flash-loan fees, then claim the entire incentive after the epoch has ended.  

1. Same address can be the borrower, lender and connector, there is no check against this.  
2. DebitaV3Loan.payDebt() allows repayment of loan in the same block it was taken. (Allows the use of flash-loan to access huge funds!)  
3. Lender can set ratio high enough to allow borrower take huge loan with dust collateral(1wei).(this reduced flash-loan needed as 1wei can be used as collateral to get unlimited principle amount reduce fees(flash-loan) and make attack more feasible/profitable).  

Internal pre-conditions  
Incentive is huge enough to cover attack expenses(flash-loan fees, loan disbursement fee and off-cus gasFee!)  

External pre-conditions  
1. Attacker has extra principle to cover flash-loan fees(0.05% in Aave V3)  
2. Attack capital becomes lower when the borrow/lend inn the current epoch is low  

Attack Path  
1. Attacker takes in account the amount of incentives and total borrow/lent of the current epoch to determine profitability and also to know if there is capital(flash-loan fee).  
2. Attacker takes flash-loan, in the flash loan call-back,  
3. A block to the end of an epoch, creates a lend offer with HUGE ratio!(100e24 for instance) allowing borrowing huge amount with 1wei, no check/limit for this  
4. creates a borrow offer using 1wei as collateral  
5. calls matchOfferV3(), matching the offers, min fee of 0.2% is deducted in which 15% of it goes back to attacker, so only 0.17% net paid as fees  
6. pays back by calling payDebt(), offcus no fee on interest since Apr is set to zero  
7. pays back flash-loan and fees  
8. epoch ends, and attacker claims almost all incentives(borrow + lend) in the next block(after the end of the epoch), since lent and borrow will be almost 100%, thanks to FLASH-LOAN!  

Attacker steals larger share of incentives

## Proof of Concept
Repayment is possible in the same block! the only tiime check is for deadline  
```solidity
// check next deadline
require(
    nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp,
    "Deadline passed to pay Debt"
);
```
ontracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L257  
} else {  
    this to be large to allow the use of dust collateral  
}  
// calculate ratio based on porcentage of the lend order  
uint ratio = (maxRatio * porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder[i]) / 10000;  
uint m_amountCollateralPerPrinciple = amountCollateralPerPrinciple[principleIndex];  
// calculate the amount of collateral used by the lender  
uint userUsedCollateral = (lendAmountPerOrder[i] *  
large loan becomes dust!  
// check ratio for each principle and check if the ratios are within the limits of the borrower  
for (uint i = 0; i < principles.length; i++) {  
    require(  
        ((ratiosForBorrower[i] * 9800) / 10000) &&  
        weightedAverageRatio[i] <=  
        (ratiosForBorrower[i] * 10200) / 10000,  
        "Invalid ratio"  
    );  
    // check if the apr is within the limits of the borrower  
    require(weightedAverageAPR[i] <= borrowInfo.maxApr, "Invalid APR");  
}

## Recommendation
1. Prevent repayment in the same block  
2. It might be helpful to prevent lender == borrower == connector
