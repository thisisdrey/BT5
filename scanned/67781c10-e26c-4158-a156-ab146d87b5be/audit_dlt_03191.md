# Vulnerability details

## Impact

It is possible for the owner to increase the tax rate to 99.9% in `setGlobalTax()`. 

The impact of this is that any future pools will be required to pay 99.9% of their rewards in tax to the `globalBeneficiary`. 

It is possible for the `globalBeneficiary` to modify this and front-run any transactions in the mem-pool which call `addPool()`. These transactions will succeed and create pools with the 99.9% tax rate.

## Proof of Concept

The cap for the tax rate is 1000 = 100%. 

```solidity
    function setGlobalTax(uint newTaxPerCapita) external {
        require(msg.sender == globalBeneficiary, 'Only globalBeneficiary can set tax');
        require(newTaxPerCapita < 1000, 'Tax too high');
        globalTaxPerCapita = newTaxPerCapita;
    }
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is recommended to put some reasonable upper bounds on the tax rate. Consider setting the upper bounds for the tax rate to 5%.
