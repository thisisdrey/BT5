# [H] i2c: rtl9300: ensure data length is within supported range

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2025-39928
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2025-10-01
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2025-39928
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=6.13.0 <6.16.8

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: rtl9300: ensure data length is within supported range

Add an explicit check for the xfer length to 'rtl9300_i2c_config_xfer'
to ensure the data length isn't within the supported range. In
particular a data length of 0 is not supported by the hardware and
causes unintended or destructive behaviour.

This limitation becomes obvious when looking at the register
documentation [1]. 4 bits are reserved for DATA_WIDTH and the value
of these 4 bits is used as N + 1, allowing a data length range of
1 <= len <= 16.

Affected by this is the SMBus Quick Operation which works with a data
length of 0. Passing 0 as the length causes an underflow of the value
due to:

(len - 1) & 0xf

and effectively specifying a transfer length of 16 via the registers.
This causes a 16-byte write operation instead of a Quick Write. For
example, on SFP modules without write-protected EEPROM this soft-bricks
them by overwriting some initial bytes.

For completeness, also add a quirk for the zero length.
