# Q3983: collateral-add via liquidate-redeem: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374) evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the vault whose share price the redemption moves, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374` -> `collateral-add`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
