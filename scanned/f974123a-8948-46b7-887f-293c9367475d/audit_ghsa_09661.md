## Details
## Summary

Agent hook events could enqueue trusted system events from unsanitized external input.

## Affected Packages / Versions

- Package: `openclaw`
- Ecosystem: npm
- Affected versions: `< 2026.4.10`
- Patched versions: `>= 2026.4.10`

## Impact

Agent hook dispatch could turn externally supplied hook metadata into trusted system events, allowing untrusted input to enter the agent as higher-trust context.

## Technical Details

The fix sanitizes hook names and marks agent hook system events as untrusted before enqueueing them.

The issue was fixed in #64372. The first stable tag containing the fix is `v2026.4.10`, and `openclaw@2026.4.14` includes the fix.

- PR: #64372

## Release Process Note

Users should upgrade to `openclaw` 2026.4.10 or newer. The latest npm release, `2026.4.14`, already includes the fix.
