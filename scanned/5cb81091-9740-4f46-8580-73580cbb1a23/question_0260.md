# Q0260: get-cached-indexes via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem varied, and assert that the value `get-cached-indexes` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
