# Q0586: Loans funding and disbursement state: batch neighbor / phase skip / exact commitment

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with one target loan plus a nearby loan in a different lifecycle phase that the attacker also controls while the loan is still `Created` with positive borrower principal receivable and zero investor principal payable and make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable, breaking the rule that the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: one target loan plus a nearby loan in a different lifecycle phase that the attacker also controls
- Exploit idea: make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable
- Invariant to test: the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing
- Fast validation: Model a create-transfer-fund-disburse sequence and assert stale ownership or stale lock state never authorizes a later epoch.
