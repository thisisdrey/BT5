# Q3619: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: expiry edge / safe confusion / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries while there are several recipient routes for the same Safe and token or collection and make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping
- Fast validation: Check that neighboring recipients, collections, or tokens cannot be reached through a superficially similar approved route.
