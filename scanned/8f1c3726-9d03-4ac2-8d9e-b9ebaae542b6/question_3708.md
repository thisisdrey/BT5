# Q3708: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: shared delegate / route widening / no cross-route bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with the same delegate address authorized on one Safe but not another Safe with similar recipients while another Safe has a similar delegate or recipient topology but no matching route and spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe, breaking the rule that a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar and leading to Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: the same delegate address authorized on one Safe but not another Safe with similar recipients
- Exploit idea: spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe
- Invariant to test: a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts
- Fast validation: Forge test one delegate across several Safes and routes and assert each transfer consumes only the exact approved route.
