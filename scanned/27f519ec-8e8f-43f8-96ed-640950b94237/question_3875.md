# Q3875: Smart account deployment and initialization: init arrays / init replay / initializer fidelity

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer while other users or systems rely on the predicted address before the account is actually deployed and make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe, breaking the rule that duplicate or crafted array inputs should not silently widen module delegates or spending surface beyond the explicit initializer semantics and leading to Bypass of intended Safe initialization or module-setup permissions?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer
- Exploit idea: make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe
- Invariant to test: duplicate or crafted array inputs should not silently widen module delegates or spending surface beyond the explicit initializer semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended Safe initialization or module-setup permissions
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated delegatecall attempts into `configureSmartAccount` and assert the one-shot guard holds in every reachable context.
