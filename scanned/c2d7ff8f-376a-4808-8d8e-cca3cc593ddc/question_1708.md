# Q1708: mask-to-list-collateral via borrow: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the future mask produced by the new debt bit reach `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `borrow` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
