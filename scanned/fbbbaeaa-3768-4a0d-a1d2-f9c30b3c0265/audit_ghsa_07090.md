# [C] OpenDJ unauthenticated SSRF, local file read and unbounded-read DoS in the DSMLv2 gateway

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: GHSA-68r5-9hpg-7qw9
CWE: CWE-400, CWE-73, CWE-918
Ecosystem: Maven
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-07-24

Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Maven: `org.openidentityplatform.opendj:opendj-dsml-servlet` — affected >=0 <5.1.2

## Details
The DSMLv2 SOAP gateway (opendj-dsml-servlet) in OpenIdentityPlatform OpenDJ through 5.1.1 dereferences attacker-supplied xsd:anyURI values server-side without a scheme allowlist, egress filtering, or a size cap, and is reachable without authentication by default. A remote unauthenticated attacker can submit a DSML add/modify request whose value is a URI to (1) perform server-side request forgery against internal services and the cloud metadata endpoint (SSRF), (2) read local files via file: URIs, and (3) exhaust memory through an unbounded response read (DoS). Fixed in 5.1.2: anyURI dereferencing is disabled by default; when enabled it is limited to an http/https allowlist, rejects loopback/link-local/private/reserved targets, refuses HTTP redirects, and caps the bytes read. The gateway also now requires container-managed authentication by default.
