# [M] Misskey Directory Traversal Vulnerability in AiScript via `Mk:api`

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2025-46559
Aliases: GHSA-gmq6-738q-vjp2
CVSS: 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N)
Published: 2025-05-05

Type: osv

## Details
Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`. Version 2025.4.1 fixes the issue.
