## Details
## Summary:
The account deletion endpoint at `POST /v1/account/destroy` does not check for 2FA and doesn't require an authorization header. Therefore, an unauthenticated attacker who knows the password of a user can delete their account without the need of 2FA.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Send a POST request to https://api-accounts.stage.mozaws.net/v1/account/destroy with the following body (do not include an Authorization header, if it is included and doesn't match the e-mail in the body, the request will fail):
```
{"email":"<email>","authPW":"<authPW>"}
```
The authPW can be calculated by the attacker since it is created client-side and the source code is [publicly available](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/fd716ec3f3461d22b847f337f6b1e899d671ee0d/packages/fxa-auth-client/lib/crypto.ts#L18).

Please refer to {F2756126} to calculate the authPW.

## Summary:
