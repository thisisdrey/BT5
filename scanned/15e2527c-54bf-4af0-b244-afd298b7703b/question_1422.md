# Q1422: interpolate-rate via deposit: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling `recipient`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `deposit` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `recipient`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `interpolate-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
