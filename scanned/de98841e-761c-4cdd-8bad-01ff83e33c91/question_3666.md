# Q3666: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: shared delegate / safe confusion / strict expiry

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with the same delegate address authorized on one Safe but not another Safe with similar recipients while the route is configured with an infinite ERC20 allowance and long validity and make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context, breaking the rule that expired allowances should never authorize any further ERC20 or ERC721 movement and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: the same delegate address authorized on one Safe but not another Safe with similar recipients
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context
- Invariant to test: expired allowances should never authorize any further ERC20 or ERC721 movement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient
- Fast validation: Model repeated finite-allowance transfers and assert the stored allowance matches the exact total transferred.
