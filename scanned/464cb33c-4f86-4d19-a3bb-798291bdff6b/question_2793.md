# Q2793: lending_account_deposit: state updated before the transfer outcome is final [a-deposit-after-a-permissionless] [cache-order]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker make `lending_account_deposit` reach `lending_account_deposit` with a deposit after a permissionless cache refresh changed bank context such that accounting mutates before the real token/value transfer is conclusively enforced, breaking `deposit must only credit the caller for actual value received into the correct bank/vault context` and causing `Critical: phantom asset credit enabling theft or unbacked borrowing`? Focus specifically on whether one earlier public instruction in the same transaction can change a cache, flag, or active-balance view before settlement.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/marginfi_account/deposit.rs` / `lending_account_deposit`
- Entrypoint: `lending_account_deposit`
- Attacker controls: a deposit after a permissionless cache refresh changed bank context
- Exploit idea: Check whether partial state mutation can survive a later transfer/accounting edge and leave the user with value or debt inconsistent with actual token movement. Focus specifically on whether one earlier public instruction in the same transaction can change a cache, flag, or active-balance view before settlement.
- Invariant to test: deposit must only credit the caller for actual value received into the correct bank/vault context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: phantom asset credit enabling theft or unbacked borrowing
- Fast validation: Inject the controlled token/account conditions and assert that any downstream failure rolls back all shares, caches, and flags atomically. Add an adversarial same-transaction precursor that changes dependent cache or balance state before the target call.
