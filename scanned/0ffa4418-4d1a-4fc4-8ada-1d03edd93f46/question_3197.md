# Q3197: Address-book role bit isolation: canonical adjacency / stale auth residue / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with self-book actions performed near canonical-book admin changes but without any privileged access while the canonical `address(this)` book and a self-managed book both contain related addresses and make register/unregister churn leave a grantee usable in later flows after its intended role was supposedly removed, breaking the rule that each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution after a wrong-role counterparty enters the lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: self-book actions performed near canonical-book admin changes but without any privileged access
- Exploit idea: make register/unregister churn leave a grantee usable in later flows after its intended role was supposedly removed
- Invariant to test: each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution after a wrong-role counterparty enters the lifecycle
- Fast validation: Forge test role-bit combinations and assert each downstream check accepts only the exact role and exact book intended.
