## Details
### Summary

Kimai 2.56.0 contains an authenticated authorization bypass in the timesheet `restart` and `duplicate` workflows. After a user loses access to a project, the user can still derive a new timesheet from one of their historical entries and create a new record under that now-unauthorized project and activity combination.

This is a permission revocation bypass with persistent write impact. The issue affects both `restart` and `duplicate`, which trust ownership of an old timesheet more than the user's current access to the underlying project, activity, and customer.

### Details

The issue affects the following operations:

- `PATCH /api/timesheets/{id}/restart`
- `PATCH /api/timesheets/{id}/duplicate`

The root cause is that authorization gives too much weight to the fact that the original timesheet belongs to the current user. In `src/Voter/TimesheetVoter.php`, the `*_own_timesheet` branch is evaluated before team-based access checks.

The restart/duplicate capability check also verifies only object visibility, not whether the current user still has team-based access to the referenced objects. 

In `src/API/TimesheetController.php`, the restart flow copies the historical `project` and `activity` into a new candidate timesheet.

The duplicate flow similarly clones the historical record and saves it.

In `src/Timesheet/TimesheetService.php`, creation of a new running entry still relies on `isGranted('start', $timesheet)`.

For historical entries that belong to the current user, this logic can still succeed through the `*_own_timesheet` branch even after project access has been revoked. As a result, normal creation pages correctly stop offering the revoked project, but `restart` and `duplicate` can still create new records under it.

The same weakness also affects the Web duplicate flow because the UI path ultimately calls the same save logic in `src/Controller/TimesheetAbstractController.php`:

*A PoC was provided, but removed for security reasons.*

### Impact

This vulnerability allows a user to keep writing new time entries into a project after project access has been revoked. That undermines administrative access-control changes and can pollute project time tracking, budget calculations, statistics, reports, and invoicing workflows.

Because both `restart` and `duplicate` can reuse historical project/activity bindings, old timesheet records effectively become reusable capability tokens that survive later access-control changes. This is not a UI artifact or a caching problem: new database rows are persisted after revocation.

# Solution

The metoid `TimesheetVoter::canStart()` now checks team access for project and activity. This verification is used for new timesheets and also for the `duplication` and `restart` workflows.
