# Q3564: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: erc20 route / route widening / no cross-route bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with token, from, to, and amount across one allowed route and one nearby disallowed route while there are several recipient routes for the same Safe and token or collection and spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe, breaking the rule that a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar and leading to Protocol-facing unauthorized transfers that later harm another user or vault?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: token, from, to, and amount across one allowed route and one nearby disallowed route
- Exploit idea: spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe
- Invariant to test: a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol-facing unauthorized transfers that later harm another user or vault
- Fast validation: Fuzz allowance expiry at the block boundary and ensure no post-expiry transfer succeeds for ERC20 or ERC721 routes.
