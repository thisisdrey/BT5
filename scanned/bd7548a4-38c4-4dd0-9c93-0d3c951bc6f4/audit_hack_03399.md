## Details
# Fee-on-transfer tokens not might leak funds

## Summary

Some ERC20 tokens implemented so a fee is taken when transferring them, for example `STA`and `PAXG`. The current implementation of the `BvbProtocol` does not take into account those kind of tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`matchOrder()` will transfer the `takerPrice` and `makerPrice` from the bull and bear to the contract. However, in case a fee on transfer is paid, the contract will receive less tokens than this `takerPrice` and `makerPrice`.

Upon `settleContract()` or `reclaimContract()`, the sum of the `takerPrice` and `makerPrice` (minus the fees for the BvB protocol itself) will be sent to the bear or the bull. This might result in the protocol in losing a part of their predefined fee. Or even, if the fee on transfer is higher than the Bull vs Bear protocol fee, unable to settle or reclaim the contract since the contract has insufficient funds.

## Impact

While this could result in funds being leaked from the contract, this only applies on fee-on-transfer assets. Hence, the risk is considered medium

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider comparing the balance of the asset before and after the transfer functions to know the actual transferred amount.
