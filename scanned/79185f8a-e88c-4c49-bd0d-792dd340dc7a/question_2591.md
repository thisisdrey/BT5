# Q2591: total-debt via transfer: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `transfer` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `transfer` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
