# [M] Samba: ctdb fails to do integrity checking of received packets

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-58224
CVSS: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2026-08-14
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-58224
Type: osv

## Details
A flaw was found in Samba's CTDB, the clustered database service used by Samba. Insufficient integrity validation of received CTDB protocol packets allows malformed packets containing invalid field lengths, improperly terminated strings, or inconsistent packet sizes to be processed without adequate bounds checking. A remote attacker with access to the CTDB private network may trigger a denial of service through process crashes or excessive memory consumption and, in limited cases, disclose adjacent memory contents.
