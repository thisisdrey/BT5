# Q2756: Vault NAV freshness and cross-contract state: cashflow withdrawal timing / stale holdings / no stale claims

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower, investor, buyer, seller, or shareholder interacting through ordinary protocol entrypoints enter through `Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals` with ordinary investor-withdraw or cashflow-collection timing around a vault-held position while the vault already has a recently finalized `lastNav`, `lastOwnershipNonce`, and `lastCalculatorConfigurationVersion` and make a user-controlled holdings change slip past the freshness gates and leave `lastNav` usable when it should not be, breaking the rule that an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone and leading to Cross-user exploit window created by ordinary borrower, buyer, or seller timing?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / _requireFreshNav, updateNav, collectCashflows, fundLoans, createSaleOffer, acceptSaleOffer
- Entrypoint: Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals
- Attacker controls: ordinary investor-withdraw or cashflow-collection timing around a vault-held position
- Exploit idea: make a user-controlled holdings change slip past the freshness gates and leave `lastNav` usable when it should not be
- Invariant to test: an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user exploit window created by ordinary borrower, buyer, or seller timing
- Fast validation: Fuzz ownershipNonce-changing actions around `_requireFreshNav` and ensure every priced approval sees the latest holdings epoch.
