# Q0758: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: tiny-large mix / timing gap / entitlement isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with alternating tiny and large payment amounts before any servicing batch runs while a vault manager could update NAV or approve deposits/redemptions soon after the borrower payment and create a borrower-controlled timing gap where real cash exists on-chain but pricing or withdrawal paths still see the wrong balances, breaking the rule that a borrower should not be able to distort another user's principal or interest entitlements just by timing ordinary payments and leading to User funds stuck or mispriced until a trusted role resolves the clearing state?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: alternating tiny and large payment amounts before any servicing batch runs
- Exploit idea: create a borrower-controlled timing gap where real cash exists on-chain but pricing or withdrawal paths still see the wrong balances
- Invariant to test: a borrower should not be able to distort another user's principal or interest entitlements just by timing ordinary payments
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck or mispriced until a trusted role resolves the clearing state
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated borrower payments before any waterfall and assert cash, clearing, and later valuation remain consistent.
