# [M] CVE-2023-30450

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2023-30450
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)
Published: 2023-04-08
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2023-30450
Type: osv

## Details
rpk in Redpanda before 23.1.2 mishandles the redpanda.rpc_server_tls field, leading to (for example) situations in which there is a data type mismatch that cannot be automatically fixed by rpk, and instead a user must reconfigure (while a cluster is turned off) in order to have TLS on broker RPC ports. NOTE: the fix was also backported to the 22.2 and 22.3 branches.
