# Q0575: Loans funding and disbursement state: role handoff / epoch confusion / no stale owner

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call while a vault, buyer, or downstream counterparty could rely on the resulting balances after funding or disbursement and make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions, breaking the rule that a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call
- Exploit idea: make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions
- Invariant to test: a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing
- Fast validation: Assert that any failed disbursement or replay attempt reverts without leaving priceable or withdrawable balances behind.
