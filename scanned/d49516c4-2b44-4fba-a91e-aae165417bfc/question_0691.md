# Q0691: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: exact amount / clearing mismatch / cash-to-clearing consistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with exact payment sizes and timestamps across repeated borrower-controlled pay calls while a vault manager could update NAV or approve deposits/redemptions soon after the borrower payment and make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes, breaking the rule that the cash held after `pay` should always have a consistent representation in borrower payment clearing for that same loan and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution between current and future investors or shareholders?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: exact payment sizes and timestamps across repeated borrower-controlled pay calls
- Exploit idea: make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes
- Invariant to test: the cash held after `pay` should always have a consistent representation in borrower payment clearing for that same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution between current and future investors or shareholders
- Fast validation: Model a vault-held loan, have the borrower pay just before NAV-sensitive approvals, and assert no stale-price claim becomes possible.
