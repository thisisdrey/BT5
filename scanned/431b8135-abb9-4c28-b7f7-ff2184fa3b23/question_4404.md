# Q4404: total-assets-preview via transfer: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury reach `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `transfer` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `total-assets-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
