# Q2299: convert-to-scaled-debt via collateral-remove: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `convert-to-scaled-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
