# Q1184: Investor withdrawal routing: mixed balances / stuck route / no stale unlocker

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value while the first loan in the batch is locked and fixes the recipient as the active unlocker and make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary, breaking the rule that a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value
- Exploit idea: make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary
- Invariant to test: a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers
- Fast validation: Forge test mixed locked/unlocked batches, duplicate ids, and ownership transfers, then assert each loan pays exactly one valid recipient once.
