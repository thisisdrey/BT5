# Q1215: Investor withdrawal routing: mixed balances / stuck route / batch isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value while a vault, exchange, or later counterparty relies on the same payable balances after the batch and make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary, breaking the rule that batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value
- Exploit idea: make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary
- Invariant to test: batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale
- Fast validation: Check that every withdrawable principal and interest balance can be claimed exactly once and never becomes unreachable after a normal epoch change.
