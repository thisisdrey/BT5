# Q3584: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: erc20 route / allowance replay / no cross-route bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with token, from, to, and amount across one allowed route and one nearby disallowed route while another Safe has a similar delegate or recipient topology but no matching route and consume more than a finite allowance by exploiting repeated-call or cross-route accounting boundaries, breaking the rule that a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: token, from, to, and amount across one allowed route and one nearby disallowed route
- Exploit idea: consume more than a finite allowance by exploiting repeated-call or cross-route accounting boundaries
- Invariant to test: a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping
- Fast validation: Fuzz allowance expiry at the block boundary and ensure no post-expiry transfer succeeds for ERC20 or ERC721 routes.
