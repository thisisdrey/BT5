# Q2267: filter-out-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
