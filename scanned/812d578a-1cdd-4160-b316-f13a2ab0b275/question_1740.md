# Q1740: subset via collateral-remove: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) reach `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it tests bitmask containment, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `subset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
