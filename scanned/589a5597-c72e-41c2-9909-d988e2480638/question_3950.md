# Q3950: report_partitioned_reward_metrics arithmetic overflows on reachable values (metrics.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `report_partitioned_reward_metrics` in `runtime/src/bank/metrics.rs` with values chosen so the arithmetic saturates, wraps, or rounds toward the attacker, and make the arithmetic in `report_partitioned_reward_metrics` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/metrics.rs` -> `report_partitioned_reward_metrics()` (around line 190)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: values chosen so the arithmetic saturates, wraps, or rounds toward the attacker
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `report_partitioned_reward_metrics` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `report_partitioned_reward_metrics` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged remote client can send TPU/QUIC traffic or transaction packets that panic, deadlock, or unboundedly grow memory in ingress, sigverify, scheduling, or PoH, halting block production across the cluster.
