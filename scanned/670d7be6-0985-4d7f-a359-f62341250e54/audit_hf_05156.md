# [H] When relisting a floor item list-

## Summary
Severity: High
Contest weight: 0.5943
Dataset id: 23219

Type: audit-finding

## Details
```solidity
Listings.sol#L625-L672 The relist function is used to refill the parameters of any token
listings, including floor item listing. For a floor item listing, users can change its owner
from address(0) to their own address without paying any fees, and set its type to DUTCH
or LIQUID. However, this operation does not change listingCount. So, when all the listing
is filled, the listingCount will be underflowed to a large num(close to uint256.max)
instead of 0. Later, in the function CollectionShutdown.sol#execute, it will be reverted as
listings.listingCount(_collection)!=0.
In Listings.sol#relist, when relist for a floor item listing, listingCount is not increased,
causing listingCount can be underflowed.
Internal pre-conditions
1. The _collection is initialized.
2. There are floor item listings in the _collection.
External pre-conditions
Attack Path
1. The attacker call relist for a floor item listing.
2. The attacker immediately calls cancelListings to cancel it, in order to refund the
tax. At the same time, listingCount is decreased. As a result, the listingCount
cannot correctly reflect the number of listings contained in _collection.
listingCount cannot correctly reflect the number of listings contained in _collection. CollectionShutdown.sol#execute will be DOSed.
```

## Recommendation
Avoid relisting floor item listings OR Increase listingCount by one.
