# Q2240: get-bitmap via liquidate: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on, the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `liquidate` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `collateral-receiver` varied, and assert that the value `get-bitmap` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
