# Q0079: lib - nonce window rotation permits replay

## Question
Given the wallet's nonce bitmap has just rotated `current` into `old`, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `w_execute_signed(msg: RequestMessage, proof: String)` - relayable by any account, replay a `RequestMessage` through `WalletEd25519` in `contracts/wallet/signatures/ed25519/src/lib.rs` across the `old`/`current` bitmap rotation driven by `timeout` and `last_cleaned_at`, breaking the invariant `the number of times one signed `RequestMessage` executes == 1` and leading to direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/wallet/signatures/ed25519/src/lib.rs](contracts/wallet/signatures/ed25519/src/lib.rs) - `WalletEd25519` (cross-check `verify_hash` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `w_execute_signed(msg: RequestMessage, proof: String)` - relayable by any account
- Attacker controls: the entire `RequestMessage` (chain_id, signer_id, nonce, deadline, ops) and the `proof` string
- Exploit idea: A nonce recorded in `current` moves to `old` and is eventually dropped; if the message's validity window outlives the bitmap retention, the same signed request executes twice. Set-up: the wallet's nonce bitmap has just rotated `current` into `old`.
- Invariant to test: the number of times one signed `RequestMessage` executes == 1
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once
- Fast validation: Advance the sandbox clock past `2 * timeout` and resubmit a still-valid signed request; assert rejection.
