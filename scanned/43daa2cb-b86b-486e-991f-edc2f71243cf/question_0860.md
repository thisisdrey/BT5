# Q860: initialize: migrated or delegated authority path accepts the wrong signer [init-plus-a-later-transfer] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `initialize` from `initialize_account` with init plus a later transfer-account path in the same investigation so a migrated, delegated, or PDA-owned account accepts the wrong authority, violating `new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context` and causing `High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `initialize`
- Entrypoint: `initialize_account`
- Attacker controls: init plus a later transfer-account path in the same investigation
- Exploit idea: Check all alternate authorization paths for mismatched signer identity, stale authority fields, or incorrect PDA derivation assumptions. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze
- Fast validation: Model authority transfer/migration and verify that only the intended signer path can mutate or close the account at each phase. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
