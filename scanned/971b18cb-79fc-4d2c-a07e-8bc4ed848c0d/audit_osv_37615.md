# [M] NanoMQ: NULL Pointer Dereference Crash in tcptran_pipe_peer During Session Restore

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-32134
Aliases: GHSA-q36f-83mh-pcv2
CVSS: 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

Type: osv

## Details
NanoMQ MQTT Broker (NanoMQ) is an all-around Edge Messaging Platform. In versions 0.24.10 and below, when NanoMQ handles high-concurrency reconnect traffic using a reconnect-collision payload, the broker can crash due to a NULL pointer dereference during MQTT session resumption for clean_start=0 clients. The transport's p_peer callback (tcptran_pipe_peer()) iterates cpipe->subinfol while copying session metadata from the cached old pipe to the new reconnecting pipe, without checking whether the pointer is NULL. Under a reconnect race, cpipe->subinfol can be freed and set to NULL before session restore invokes this function, resulting in a remote unauthenticated Denial-of-Service (process crash) condition. This issue has been fixed in version 0.24.11.
