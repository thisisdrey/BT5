# Q4521: unpack-u16 via call-ststx-ratio: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, drive `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) — which unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word — to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, breaking the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `unpack-u16` touches, run `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
