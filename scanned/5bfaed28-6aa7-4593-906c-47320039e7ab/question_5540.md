# Q5540: refresh via liquidate-multi: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with the full batch list and its ordering varied, and assert that the value `refresh` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
