# [M] Lack of check whether the caller of `withdrawToken()` function is the Bull or not

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Reporter: 0xmuxyz

## Details
# Lack of check whether the caller of `withdrawToken()` function is the Bull or not

## Summary
- Lack of check whether the caller of `withdrawToken()` function is the Bull or not

## Vulnerability Detail
- On the assumption is that, when `withdrawToken()` function is used is written in the document like below:
   - In case the Bull cannot accept NFTs (eg a malicious smart contract), the NFT is kept in our smart contract and can be later retrieved by the Bull through a call to function `withdrawToken`
      https://bullvbear.gitbook.io/home/understanding-the-protocol/smart-contracts#settlement-by-the-option-buyer-bear

- Based on the assumption (context) of `withdrawToken()` function above, only the Bull should can call the `withdrawToken()` function. 
  - However, there is no check whether the caller of the `withdrawToken()` is the Bull or not. 
  - Therefore, the Bear and any external user who is neither the Bull nor the Bear can call `withdrawToken()` function.
        

## Impact
- For example, this vulnerability can lead to negative impact like below:
  - If the caller besides the Bull can call `withdrawToken()` function, the Bull may receive a NFT when they doesn't hope and intend.
   - If the caller besides the Bull can call `withdrawToken()` function, the Bull may receive a NFT that they doesn't want to receive. 


## Code Snippet
- Below is the code snippet that is lack of check whether the caller of `withdrawToken()` function is the Bull or not.
   https://github.com/masaun/2022-11-bullvbear-masaun/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L450-L462
```solidity
    function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public {
        address collection = matchedOrders[uint(orderHash)].collection;

        address recipient = withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId];

        // Transfer NFT to recipient
        IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId);

        // This token is not withdrawable anymore
        withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId] = address(0);

        emit WithdrawnToken(orderHash, tokenId, recipient);
    }
```

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Should add a condition for checking whether a caller of `withdrawToken()` is the Bull (=Option seller) or not by using `require()` statement to the `withdrawToken()` function. 
   - Below is an example code. 
   - NOTE: In the example code below, there is also the check whether the Bull is recipient or not (just in case).
```solidity
    function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public {
        address collection = matchedOrders[uint(orderHash)].collection;

        // ContractId
        uint contractId = uint(orderHash);

        // Retrieve the bull address
        address bull = bulls[contractId];
        require(bull == msg.sender, "Only bull can call withdrawToken function");

        address recipient = withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId]; //@dev - Original code

        // Check that only the bull can call the withdrawToken() function
        require(bull == recipient, "Recipient must be bull");

        // Transfer NFT to recipient
        IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId);

        // This token is not withdrawable anymore
        withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId] = address(0);

        emit WithdrawnToken(orderHash, tokenId, recipient);
    }
```
