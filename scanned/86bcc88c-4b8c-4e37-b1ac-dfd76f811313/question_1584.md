# Q1584: lib - gas starvation of the resolver callback (8)

## Question
Given the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `mt_transfer_call` / `mt_batch_transfer_call` to a receiver contract the attacker deployed, choose `min_gas` / `state_init` / batch size at the entrypoint so the `add_action` callback in `crates/near/promise/src/lib.rs` runs out of gas after the debit, leaving the balance burned with no refund, breaking the invariant `the resolver callback always executes with enough gas to restore the debited balance` and leading to permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/near/promise/src/lib.rs](crates/near/promise/src/lib.rs) - `add_action` (cross-check `estimate_gas` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `mt_transfer_call` / `mt_batch_transfer_call` to a receiver contract the attacker deployed
- Attacker controls: `receiver_id`, `token_ids`, `amounts`, `memo`, `msg`, and the receiver's return value
- Exploit idea: The floors (`FT_TRANSFER_CALL_GAS_MIN`, `MT_BATCH_TRANSFER_GAS_MIN`, `AuthCall::MIN_GAS_DEFAULT`, `STATE_INIT_GAS`) plus `with_unused_gas_weight(0)` are the only protection; probe whether a caller-chosen value passes the floor but starves the resolve step. Set-up: the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value.
- Invariant to test: the resolver callback always executes with enough gas to restore the debited balance
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)
- Fast validation: Sweep `min_gas` and token-count values; assert the resolver completes for every value the entrypoint accepts.
