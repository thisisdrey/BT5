# Q2667: resolve-price-feed via liquidate-redeem: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`resolve-price-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332) dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332` -> `resolve-price-feed`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `resolve-price-feed` dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-price-feed` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
