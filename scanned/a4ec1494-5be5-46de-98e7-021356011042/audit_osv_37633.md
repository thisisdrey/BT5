# [C] Sunshine: Authentication bypass via improper client certificate validation

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: CVE-2026-32253
Aliases: GHSA-ph75-mgxh-mv57
CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Type: osv

## Details
Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. In versions prior to 2026.516.143833, the client-certificate authentication can be bypassed because of how OpenSSL verification results are handled. In src/crypto.cpp, the custom verify callback treats X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY, X509_V_ERR_CERT_NOT_YET_VALID, and X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED as success. This can allow an untrusted certificate to pass authentication and access protected HTTPS endpoints. This issue has been fixed in version 2026.516.143833.
