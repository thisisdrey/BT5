# [H] CL-2026-04: Yamux memory exhaustion via unbounded pending frames queue

## Summary
Severity: High
Chain: Ethereum (consensus layer)
Component: Lighthouse

Type: ef-disclosure

## Details
Yamux Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability can crash all Lighthouse Nodes
Attack scenario *
More detailed description of the attack/bug scenario and unexpected/buggy behaviour
The Rust implementation of the Yamux stream multiplexer uses a vector for pending frames. This vector is not bounded in length. Every time the Yamux protocol requires sending of a new frame, this frame gets appended to this vector. This can be remotely triggered in a number of ways, for example by:

1. Opening a new Identify stream. This causes the node to send its Identify message. Of course, every other protocol that causes the sending of data also works. The larger the response, the more data is enqueued.
2. Sending a Yamux Ping frame. This causes a Pong frame to be enqueued.

Under normal circumstances, this queue of pending frames would be drained once they’re sent out over the network. However, the attacker can use TCP’s receive window mechanism to prevent the victim from sending out any data: By not reading from the TCP connection, the receive window will never be increased, and the victim won’t be able to send out any new data (this is how TCP implements backpressure). Once this happens, Yamux’s queue of pending frames will start growing indefinitely. The queue will only be drained once the underlying TCP connection is closed.
Impact *
 Describe the effect this may have in a production setting
An attacker can cause a remote node to run out of memory, which will result in the corresponding process getting terminated by the operating system.

The proof of concept uses Identify to make the remote node queue Yamux DATA frames. This variant of the attack is not very efficient, since Identify messages are relatively small. Roughly, for every byte transferred, the victim enqueues one byte of data.

Depending on the application protocols running on top of rust-libp2p, higher amplification factors are possible. For example, image a protocol that sends out 10 MB of data as a result of an incoming request. By issuing that request and sending a Yamux stream window update (together ~100-200 bytes), the victim would now enqueue the entire 10 MB into its frame buffer. Any block transfer / sync protocols might be good candidates.

In addition to consuming huge amounts of memory, this attack also drives up the victim's CPU load, such that the allocation of memory at some point becomes CPU-limited. In my tests, I was able to crash a Lighthouse node running on a 4 CPU, 8 GB cloud machine in less than 2 minutes, using the unoptimized attack using the Identify protocol, as described above. It's expected that with more optimization work, this time could be significantly reduced.

It seems feasible to target a large number of Lighthouse nodes at the same time, bringing down a significant part of the network, using just a small number of well-connected (high-bandwidth) attacking servers.

Reproduction *
If used any sort of tools/simulations to find the bug, describe in detail how to reproduce the buggy behaviour.
Here's a (secret) Gist containing a proof of concept: https://gist.github.com/marten-seemann/11ce501187dfdced48762ebd33ed91c8. It's written in Go, since that's the language I'm most familiar with.

To run this code, you need to check out https://github.com/libp2p/go-yamux first and apply the patch (yamux-session.diff). This patch allows us to inject Yamux messages. Then update the replace path in the go.mod file to point to the patched yamux version.
Fix
Description of suggested fix, if available
An application accepting input from the network should never create an unbounded queue, under any circumstances. There are multiple ways to fix this problem:

1. Explicitly limit the number of queued frames, and kill the connection once the limit is reached. The limit can be chosen fairly high (1000 frames?), to ensure that it’s not hit in practice.
2. Ideally, network protocols provide backpressure in situations where they’re struggling to keep up with the load. One way to achieve backpressuring in this case would be by slowing down / blocking the read loop if the write loop can’t keep up sending out the responses. This would stop the attacker, since it would eventually run out of TCP send window, and not be able to trigger the sending of any new frames.
Details
Any details not covered above
This attack is inspired by the HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack (CVE 2023-44487), HTTP/2 Ping Flood (CVE-2019-9512), and the QUIC Path Validation attack (see my blog post: https://seemann.io/posts/2023-12-18-exploiting-quics-path-validation/).
