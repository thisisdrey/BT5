# [M] Kata Containers: Unauthorized mem-agent ttRPC methods let an untrusted host tamper with confidential-guest memory

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-64676
Aliases: GHSA-h8jv-63p2-496x
CVSS: 5.7 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L)

Type: osv

## Details
Kata Containers is an open source implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that perform like containers. In versions prior to 4.0.0, the kata-agent is vulnerable to an authorization bypass in confidential-guest memory management. In Confidential Containers (CoCo) deployments, the kata-agent enforces an OPA/Rego-based AgentPolicy that must authorize every ttRPC API call, forming the security boundary that prevents an untrusted host from directing the confidential guest. Two ttRPC methods introduced with the mem-agent feature are missing this authorization check, so an untrusted host can invoke them unconditionally regardless of the guest's policy configuration. When mem-agent is enabled (off by default), this lets the host tamper with in-guest memory management by forcing swap, aggressive eviction, or compaction, resulting in attacker-controlled availability and performance degradation of the confidential workload entirely outside the agent-policy boundary. The impact does not include memory disclosure or code execution, and severity is bounded by the precondition that mem-agent must be explicitly enabled. This issue is fixed in version 4.0.0.
