## Details
# If collateral > 0, it pulls from msg.sender into this contract, then deposits to market. On withdraw, it goes directly to msg.sender. This asymmetry can lead to confusion.
## Summary
There is an asymmetry in how collateral is transferred between the msg.sender and the market contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
When depositing positive collateral:
1.  Collateral is pulled from msg.sender into the MultiInvoker contract then deposited from MultiInvoker into the market: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L183-L185)
3. But when withdrawing, Collateral is withdrawn directly from the market to msg.sender: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L187) and [Link 3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L189)
This can lead to confusion since deposits go through an intermediate step via MultiInvoker but withdraws do not. It also means there is no validation on the withdraw side that the market actually transferred the expected collateral to msg.sender.




## Impact
This can allow the market to not properly transfer the withdrawn collateral, while MultiInvoker believes it was correctly handled.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Withdrawals should go through MultiInvoker similar to deposits:
1. Market withdraws collateral to MultiInvoker
2. MultiInvoker withdraws collateral to msg.sender

This adds symmetry on deposit and withdraw and allows MultiInvoker to validate the correct collateral amount is withdrawn from the market
