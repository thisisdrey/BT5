# Q4997: receive-tokens via liquidate: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `collateral-receiver`, drive `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) — which pulls an asset from a named account — to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, breaking the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `liquidate` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `collateral-receiver`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
