# Q2368: create via repay: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal reach `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `repay` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
