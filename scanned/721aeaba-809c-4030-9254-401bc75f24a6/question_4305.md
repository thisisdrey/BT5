# Q4305: gas counter arithmetic near the u64 ceiling — vmstate.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM calling the host function directly inside a `FunctionCall`, a call sequence engineered to drive burnt/used gas close to u64::MAX, with the input length one byte past the accepted maximum, and additionally with a (ptr,len) pair whose sum overflows the address space, reach `set` in `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/logic/vmstate.rs` and make the gas counter wrap or saturate so execution continues past the gas limit, breaking the invariant that gas accounting is checked arithmetic and always terminates execution at the limit, leading to Critical - Direct loss of funds (protocol-level balance created, destroyed, or moved outside protocol rules)?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/logic/vmstate.rs` :: `set`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM calling the host function directly inside a `FunctionCall`
- Attacker controls: a call sequence engineered to drive burnt/used gas close to u64::MAX; with the input length one byte past the accepted maximum; with a (ptr,len) pair whose sum overflows the address space
- Exploit idea: make the gas counter wrap or saturate so execution continues past the gas limit
- Invariant to test: gas accounting is checked arithmetic and always terminates execution at the limit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct loss of funds (protocol-level balance created, destroyed, or moved outside protocol rules)
- Fast validation: unit test on the gas counter with near-ceiling values
