# Q2747: set_primary_username can write state that another public path misreads

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `set_primary_username` to create or mutate storage that a different public entrypoint later interprets more permissively than intended?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/identity/src/lib.rs::set_primary_username
- Entrypoint: signed extrinsic `set_primary_username`
- Attacker controls: call repetition, batching order, and surrounding state
- Exploit idea: Look for state shared across multiple public entrypoints but validated differently by each one.
- Invariant to test: Shared storage must have one consistent meaning across every public path that consumes it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized account or call control leading to fund theft or governance capture
- Fast validation: After exercising the entrypoint, call every other public function that touches the same object family and check for inconsistent interpretation.
