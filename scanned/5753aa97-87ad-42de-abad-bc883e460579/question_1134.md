# Q1134: sync_indexer_flags: account-state transition skips a mandatory precondition [a-sync-call-after-flashloan] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `sync_indexer_flags` with a sync call after flashloan flags were set and cleared so `sync_indexer_flags` performs a state transition without validating a required precondition, breaking `synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly` and causing `Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `sync_indexer_flags`
- Entrypoint: `sync_indexer_flags`
- Attacker controls: a sync call after flashloan flags were set and cleared
- Exploit idea: Focus on initialize/close/freeze/sync transitions where one branch may skip a check that sibling branches enforce. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact
- Fast validation: Hit the suspect branch directly in a test and assert it rejects the same invalid pre-state that other equivalent branches reject. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
