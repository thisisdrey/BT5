# Q0146: Loans create authorization: role overlap / unauthorized create / caller binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with the same attacker-controlled address reused across multiple loan roles while the attacker has only self-registered role bits in its own address book and no canonical approvals and make `create` accept a caller that is neither the approved originator nor an admin/guardian, breaking the rule that the `originator` parameter and the effective caller identity should never diverge for an unprivileged transaction and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and role-based access control?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: the same attacker-controlled address reused across multiple loan roles
- Exploit idea: make `create` accept a caller that is neither the approved originator nor an admin/guardian
- Invariant to test: the `originator` parameter and the effective caller identity should never diverge for an unprivileged transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and role-based access control
- Fast validation: Build a minimal scenario where a toxic loan would later be fundable or priceable, and assert the creation step itself cannot be reached by an unprivileged caller.
