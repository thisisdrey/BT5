# Q3319: TrustedCalls delegate execution: selector shape / payload extension / atomic batch intent

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with calldata whose first 4 bytes are trusted while the remaining payload is attacker-chosen while the trusted call eventually reaches Loans, PortfolioVault, or LoansExchange through the Safe and use trusted selector matching to smuggle attacker-chosen semantics past the intended whitelist boundary, breaking the rule that batched trusted calls should not leave a partially successful operational state that another unprivileged user can exploit and leading to Protocol state corruption reached through a supposedly trusted but actually overbroad delegate surface?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: calldata whose first 4 bytes are trusted while the remaining payload is attacker-chosen
- Exploit idea: use trusted selector matching to smuggle attacker-chosen semantics past the intended whitelist boundary
- Invariant to test: batched trusted calls should not leave a partially successful operational state that another unprivileged user can exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol state corruption reached through a supposedly trusted but actually overbroad delegate surface
- Fast validation: Check that a delegate of one Safe cannot drive Loans, Vault, or Exchange state as if acting for another Safe.
