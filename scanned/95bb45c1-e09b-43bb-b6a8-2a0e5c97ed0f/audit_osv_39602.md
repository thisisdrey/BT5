drm/xe/pf: Fix sysfs initialization

In case of devm_add_action_or_reset() failure the provided cleanup
action will be run immediately on the not yet initialized kobject.
This may lead to errors like:

 [ ] kobject: '(null)' (ff110001393608e0): is not initialized, yet kobject_put() is being called.
 [ ] WARNING: lib/kobject.c:734 at kobject_put+0xd9/0x250, CPU#0: kworker/0:0/9

Fix that by calling kobject_init() and kobject_add() separately
and register cleanup action after the kobject is initialized.

Also make this cleanup registration a part of the create helper to
fix another mistake, as in the loop we were wrongly passing parent
kobject while registering cleanup action, and this resulted in some
undetected leaks.
