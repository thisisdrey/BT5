# Q2332: calculate-asset-notional-value via liquidate: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `calculate-asset-notional-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544` -> `calculate-asset-notional-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Reach it through `liquidate` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
