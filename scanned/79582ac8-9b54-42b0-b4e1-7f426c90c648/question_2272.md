# Q2272: interest-rate via liquidate-multi: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
