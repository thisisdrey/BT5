# Q3168: calc-index-next via collateral-remove-redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-index-next` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
