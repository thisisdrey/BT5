# Q1659: iter-lookup-collateral via liquidate: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
`iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `collateral-receiver`, use that to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `liquidate` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `iter-lookup-collateral` touches, run `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
