# Q1037: can_be_closed: indexer-facing flags diverge from enforceable state [a-close-attempt-after-tiny] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker make `close_account` drive `can_be_closed` with a close attempt after tiny repay/withdraw operations that may zero one side only so indexer or auxiliary flags diverge from enforceable state and later unlock `High: permanent loss, stranding, or unauthorized release of live exposure` by violating `closeability must require the full absence of live economic exposure, blocking flags, and value-bearing side state`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `can_be_closed`
- Entrypoint: `close_account`
- Attacker controls: a close attempt after tiny repay/withdraw operations that may zero one side only
- Exploit idea: Look for user-triggered sync or bookkeeping paths that appear informational but influence later authorization or closeability decisions. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: closeability must require the full absence of live economic exposure, blocking flags, and value-bearing side state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent loss, stranding, or unauthorized release of live exposure
- Fast validation: Mutate the controlled flags, then immediately call dependent instructions and assert they still enforce the true on-chain state. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
