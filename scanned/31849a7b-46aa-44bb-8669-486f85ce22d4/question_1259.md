# Q1259: Investor withdrawal routing: epoch split / batch bleed / batch isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with one loan from a fresh ownership epoch and one loan from a prior epoch that shares the same apparent investor or unlocker while a sale offer was recently accepted or cancelled before the batch executes and make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it, breaking the rule that batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: one loan from a fresh ownership epoch and one loan from a prior epoch that shares the same apparent investor or unlocker
- Exploit idea: make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it
- Invariant to test: batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers
- Fast validation: Fuzz batched loan ordering and payable compositions and assert the first loan's cached recipient never bleeds into another loan improperly.
