# Q462: change_asset_shares: cache refresh ordering permits stale acceptance [a-repeated-withdraw-redeposit-cycle] [cycle]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `lending_account_withdraw` with a repeated withdraw/redeposit cycle around the same small amount so `change_asset_shares` accepts a state transition using stale cache values before refresh or recomputation, violating `asset-share reductions must exactly match released value and cannot free more liquidity than the user economically owns` and causing `Critical: direct theft or unauthorized withdrawal of protocol/user funds`? Focus specifically on whether the attacker can repeat the same path in a short deterministic cycle to compound a one-step drift.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/bank.rs` / `change_asset_shares`
- Entrypoint: `lending_account_withdraw`
- Attacker controls: a repeated withdraw/redeposit cycle around the same small amount
- Exploit idea: Audit whether the instruction depends on cached bank/account state that can lag behind the exact balances or prices settled later in the same path. Focus specifically on whether the attacker can repeat the same path in a short deterministic cycle to compound a one-step drift.
- Invariant to test: asset-share reductions must exactly match released value and cannot free more liquidity than the user economically owns
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: direct theft or unauthorized withdrawal of protocol/user funds
- Fast validation: Prepare mismatched cache and live state, invoke the instruction, and assert acceptance never occurs unless recomputed state would still satisfy the rules. Run the target path in a short deposit/withdraw or borrow/repay style loop and assert no monotonic gain appears.
