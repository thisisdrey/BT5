# Q2068: Vault async deposit flow: multi-request / ratio drift / no stranded claim

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with multiple pending deposit requests for the same controller before any claim while the manager approves only part of the pending assets before later approvals and make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable approved value and leading to Accounting issue in the vault leading to underbacked claimable shares?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: multiple pending deposit requests for the same controller before any claim
- Exploit idea: make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable approved value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in the vault leading to underbacked claimable shares
- Fast validation: Forge test two requests plus multiple partial approvals, then claim in alternating asset and share units and assert counter conservation.
