# Q3003: Address-book role bit isolation: book churn / whitelist bypass / precise unregister

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with rapid register/unregister cycles for the same grantee across different roles while the canonical `address(this)` book and a self-managed book both contain related addresses and make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present, breaking the rule that unregistering one role should not leave or remove unrelated role authority unexpectedly and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: rapid register/unregister cycles for the same grantee across different roles
- Exploit idea: make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present
- Invariant to test: unregistering one role should not leave or remove unrelated role authority unexpectedly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules
- Fast validation: Model one self-managed book plus the canonical book and assert they can never substitute for each other.
