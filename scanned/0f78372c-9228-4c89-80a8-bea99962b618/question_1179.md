# Q1179: sync_indexer_flags: freeze semantics can be bypassed through an alternate user flow [a-sync-call-after-a] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker bypass the intended freeze semantics by invoking `sync_indexer_flags` with a sync call after a liquidate-start or liquidate-end transition so `sync_indexer_flags` still changes a blocked account, violating `synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly` and causing `Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `sync_indexer_flags`
- Entrypoint: `sync_indexer_flags`
- Attacker controls: a sync call after a liquidate-start or liquidate-end transition
- Exploit idea: Audit alternate user flows that eventually touch the same balances but may not call the common frozen-account guard. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact
- Fast validation: Freeze the account, exercise alternate paths, and assert every value-moving route rejects before any state mutation occurs. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
