# Q1854: Exchange offer lifecycle: address-book churn / bundle inconsistency / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance while one side is a vault or later counterparty that relies on precise lock cleanup and delivery semantics and make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance
- Exploit idea: make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer
- Fast validation: Forge test directed offers with multiple loans, expiry edges, and registration churn, then assert full delivery or full revert.
