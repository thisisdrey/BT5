# Q1359: accounts_hasher_thread_pool grows memory without an enforced bound (accounts_lt_hash.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `accounts_hasher_thread_pool` in `runtime/src/bank/accounts_lt_hash.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and grow the buffer `accounts_hasher_thread_pool` feeds without any eviction bound taking effect, so that the invariant "Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/accounts_lt_hash.rs` -> `accounts_hasher_thread_pool()` (around line 464)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Repeatedly drive `accounts_hasher_thread_pool` so a buffer, map, or cache it feeds grows without eviction, exhausting node memory below the cost the attacker pays.
- Invariant to test: Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Stress the path and assert the container's size plateaus rather than growing linearly with attacker input.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply force sigverify, dedup, scheduling, or buffering work that vastly exceeds the fees ever collected, degrading the leader below true cost.
