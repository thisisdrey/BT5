# Q0788: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: charged-off pay / clearing mismatch / no exploitable pricing gap

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with payments into a loan that is `ChargedOff` but still accepts borrower payments while no waterfall has yet moved the fresh payment out of `ACC_BORROWER_PAYMENT_CLEARING` and make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes, breaking the rule that a borrower-controlled payment timing sequence should not let another unprivileged user exploit a vault approval or withdrawal against stale economic state and leading to User funds stuck or mispriced until a trusted role resolves the clearing state?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: payments into a loan that is `ChargedOff` but still accepts borrower payments
- Exploit idea: make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes
- Invariant to test: a borrower-controlled payment timing sequence should not let another unprivileged user exploit a vault approval or withdrawal against stale economic state
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck or mispriced until a trusted role resolves the clearing state
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated borrower payments before any waterfall and assert cash, clearing, and later valuation remain consistent.
