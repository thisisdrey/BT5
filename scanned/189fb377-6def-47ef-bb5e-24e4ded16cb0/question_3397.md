# Q3397: TrustedCalls delegate execution: shared delegate / payload extension / per-safe auth

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with a delegate address reused across several Safes with different trust surfaces while the whitelist contains the target/selector pair for a legitimate operational path and use trusted selector matching to smuggle attacker-chosen semantics past the intended whitelist boundary, breaking the rule that a delegate authorization should apply only to the exact Safe that granted it and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and Safe-module access control?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: a delegate address reused across several Safes with different trust surfaces
- Exploit idea: use trusted selector matching to smuggle attacker-chosen semantics past the intended whitelist boundary
- Invariant to test: a delegate authorization should apply only to the exact Safe that granted it
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and Safe-module access control
- Fast validation: Forge test one delegate address across multiple Safes and assert each execute path remains bound to the granting Safe only.
