## Details
# Updating positions before transferring fees means fees could be lost if transfer reverts.
## Summary
Updating positions before transferring fees means fees could be lost if transfer reverts. Should transfer first. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The main vulnerability is that _update() calls market.update() to update positions before withdrawing fees. If the fee withdrawal were to fail/revert for some reason, the fees would be lost.
## Impact
If _withdraw() were to revert, the fee transfer would fail but the position update would still occur, losing fees.
