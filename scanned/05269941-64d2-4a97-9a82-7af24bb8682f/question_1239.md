# Q1239: chunk apply determinism under time or iteration order — prepare_transactions.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `FunctionCall` action into an attacker-deployed contract, a receipt mix whose processing order depends on map iteration or wall-clock deadlines, when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit, reach the primary handler in this file in `chain/client/src/prepare_transactions.rs` and have two honest producers of the same chunk reach different results, breaking the invariant that chunk application is a pure function of the previous state and the chunk contents, leading to Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/client/src/prepare_transactions.rs` :: primary handler
- Entrypoint: a `FunctionCall` action into an attacker-deployed contract
- Attacker controls: a receipt mix whose processing order depends on map iteration or wall-clock deadlines; when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit
- Exploit idea: have two honest producers of the same chunk reach different results
- Invariant to test: chunk application is a pure function of the previous state and the chunk contents
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork
- Fast validation: differential test applying one chunk repeatedly with shuffled ordering
