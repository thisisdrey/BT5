## Details
The _depositWithdraw method in AssetManager has the following implementation:
```solidity
function _depositWithdraw(address assetAddress, bool deposit, address sender, uint256 amount) private {
    if (deposit) {
        IERC20(assetAddress).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), amount);
    } else {
        IERC20(assetAddress).safeTransfer(sender, amount);
    }
}
```
Also before/after it is called we have code like this:
```solidity
assetDeposit.depositAmount -= amount;
userDeposit.depositAmount -= amount;
```
and this
```solidity
assetDeposit.depositAmount += amount;
userDeposit.depositAmount += amount;
```
This code does not account for tokens that have a fee-on-transfer or a rebasing (token balance going up/down without transfers) mechanisms. By caching (or removing) the amount given to the transfer or transferFrom methods of the ERC20 token, this implies that this will be the actual received/sent out amount by the protocol and that it will be static, but that is not guaranteed to be the case. If fee-on-transfer tokens are used, on deposit action the actual received amount will be less, so withdrawing the same balance won't be possible. For rebasing tokens it is also possible that the contract's balance decreases over time, which will lead to the same problem as with the fee-on-transfer tokens, and if the balance increases then the reward will be stuck in the AssetManager contract.

## Recommendation
You can either explicitly document that you do not support tokens with a fee-on-transfer or rebasing mechanism or you can do the following: For fee-on-transfer tokens, check the balance before and after the transfer and validate it is the same as the amount argument provided. For rebasing tokens, when they go down in value, you should have a method to update the cached reserves accordingly, based on the balance held. This is a complex solution. For rebasing tokens, when they go up in value, you should add a method to actually transfer the excess tokens out of the protocol (possibly directly to users).
