# Q4640: calc-cumulative-debt via accrue: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update reach `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it multiplies scaled principal by an index, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `accrue` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update varied, and assert that the value `calc-cumulative-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
