# [H] pyasn1 BER/CER/DER decoder denial of service via unbounded long-form tag IDs

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-m4p7-r5rc-7g4j
CVE: CVE-2026-59884
CWE: CWE-400
Ecosystem: PyPI
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-07-21

Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- PyPI: `pyasn1` — affected >=0 <0.6.4

## Details
### Impact
The BER decoder (shared by the CER and DER codecs) parses long-form tags by accumulating continuation octets in a loop with no upper bound on the size of the tag ID. A crafted input can force the decoder to build an arbitrarily large integer, with CPU cost growing quadratically in input size — a ~1 MB input consumes over a minute of CPU. On Python 3.11+, the oversized tag ID can also trigger an unhandled `ValueError` (integer string conversion limit) while the decoder formats error messages, violating the documented `PyAsn1Error` contract and potentially bypassing caller error handling.

Any application decoding untrusted BER/CER/DER input is affected.

### Affected components
- `pyasn1.codec.ber.decoder` — `decode()` and `StreamingDecoder`
- `pyasn1.codec.cer.decoder` and `pyasn1.codec.der.decoder`, which inherit
  the same tag parsing
- `pyasn1.type.tag` — `Tag`/`TagSet` reprs could raise `ValueError` when
  rendering oversized tag IDs (reachable through decoder error paths)

The encoders and the `pyasn1.codec.native` codec are not affected.

### Patches
Fixed in 0.6.4. Long-form tag IDs are now limited to 20 octets (140-bit tag IDs, matching the existing OID arc limit); oversized tags are rejected with `PyAsn1Error`. Tag ID rendering in reprs and error messages was additionally hardened against the interpreter's integer-to-string conversion limit.

### Workarounds
Bound the size of untrusted input passed to `decode()` before calling it.
