# Q4364: merge-price via liquidate: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering varied, and assert that the value `merge-price` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
