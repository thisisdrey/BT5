# Q3603: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: expiry edge / safe confusion / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries while the route is configured with an infinite ERC20 allowance and long validity and make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient
- Fast validation: Model repeated finite-allowance transfers and assert the stored allowance matches the exact total transferred.
