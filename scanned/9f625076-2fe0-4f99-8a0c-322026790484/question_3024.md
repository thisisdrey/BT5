# Q3024: receive-tokens via transfer: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation reach `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it pulls an asset from a named account, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `transfer` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `receive-tokens` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
