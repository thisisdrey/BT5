# Q4666: integer representation of balances in views — serialize.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `query` / `call_function` view request on a public RPC node, balances near u128::MAX and values that lose precision in the view representation, with a non-minimal length prefix, and additionally with a duplicate or out-of-range enum discriminant, reach `visit_unit` in `core/primitives-core/src/serialize.rs` and make an integration read a balance that differs from the protocol value, breaking the invariant that balances are represented losslessly in every serialised form, leading to Critical - Direct loss of funds (protocol-level balance created, destroyed, or moved outside protocol rules)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives-core/src/serialize.rs` :: `visit_unit`
- Entrypoint: a `query` / `call_function` view request on a public RPC node
- Attacker controls: balances near u128::MAX and values that lose precision in the view representation; with a non-minimal length prefix; with a duplicate or out-of-range enum discriminant
- Exploit idea: make an integration read a balance that differs from the protocol value
- Invariant to test: balances are represented losslessly in every serialised form
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct loss of funds (protocol-level balance created, destroyed, or moved outside protocol rules)
- Fast validation: round-trip test over extreme balance values
