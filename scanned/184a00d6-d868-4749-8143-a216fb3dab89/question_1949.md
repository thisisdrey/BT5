# Q1949: add-user-collateral via borrow: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, drive `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) — which adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `borrow` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
