# Q0143: Loans create authorization: role overlap / toxic loan seed / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with the same attacker-controlled address reused across multiple loan roles while the canonical address book already contains at least one genuinely approved originator and seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate, breaking the rule that borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only and leading to Accounting issue in Loans caused by unauthorized lifecycle initialization?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: the same attacker-controlled address reused across multiple loan roles
- Exploit idea: seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate
- Invariant to test: borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans caused by unauthorized lifecycle initialization
- Fast validation: Fuzz `msg.sender`, the `originator` parameter, and address-book contents, then assert every successful create binds to a canonically approved originator only.
