# Q0233: Loans create authorization: contract receiver / role confusion / canonical gate

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with an attacker-controlled contract as the proposed investor plus separate EOAs for the other roles while the target counterparty addresses are registered and unregistered across attacker-controlled books in nearby transactions and reuse one role approval context to satisfy a different role check and initialize a loan with unauthorized parties, breaking the rule that only the canonical `address(this)` originator book should authorize loan creation and leading to Accounting issue in Loans caused by unauthorized lifecycle initialization?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: an attacker-controlled contract as the proposed investor plus separate EOAs for the other roles
- Exploit idea: reuse one role approval context to satisfy a different role check and initialize a loan with unauthorized parties
- Invariant to test: only the canonical `address(this)` originator book should authorize loan creation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans caused by unauthorized lifecycle initialization
- Fast validation: Fuzz `msg.sender`, the `originator` parameter, and address-book contents, then assert every successful create binds to a canonically approved originator only.
