## Details
# `describe_transfer` wallet-rpc indexes the ring with `real_output_in_tx_index` instead of `real_output` → cold-wallet pre-sign review shows a decoy as the "real input"

**Repository:** [`monero-project/monero`](https://github.com/monero-project/monero) — `src/wallet/wallet_rpc_server.cpp`. Reproduced against unmodified upstream source built from `/home/beni/Monero/monero-src` (HEAD `082b600a2`, master). The same two lines exist on `release-v0.18`.

## Summary

`describe_transfer` is the JSON-RPC method a cold-wallet operator (or a GUI / payment integration wrapping `monero-wallet-rpc`) calls before signing an unsigned or multisig txset, to see what the transaction is actually going to do. For each input it returns a `sources[i]` block that includes `global_index` and `pubkey` — advertised as the real ring entry being spent.

The handler reads those two fields from the wrong slot of the ring. `tx_source_entry` carries two distinct numbers: `real_output` (the position of the real entry inside `outputs`, the ring) and `real_output_in_tx_index` (the position the output had inside its source transaction's `vout`). They are not the same. `outputs` is the ring (size = ring_size, currently 16); `real_output_in_tx_index` is bounded only by the source tx's vout length and is `0` for any coinbase-derived UTXO. `on_describe_transfer` indexes the ring with the second number, so the global_index and pubkey it shows the operator describe whichever ring slot happens to sit at position `real_output_in_tx_index` — usually a decoy.

The signing path is unaffected. `construct_tx_with_tx_key` reads the real entry from `outputs[real_output]` (`cryptonote_tx_utils.cpp:365,373`); so do `multisig_tx_builder_ringct.cpp:113` and `simplewallet.cpp:6213`. Only this RPC mixes them up. The result is that `describe_transfer` and the broadcast tx disagree about which output the wallet is about to spend.

Buggy block, `src/wallet/wallet_rpc_server.cpp` (master `082b600a2`):

```cpp
1564  for (size_t s = 0; s < cd.sources.size(); ++s)
1565  {
1566    const cryptonote::tx_source_entry &src_in = cd.sources[s];
1567    wallet_rpc::COMMAND_RPC_DESCRIBE_TRANSFER::source &src_out = desc.sources.emplace_back();
1568    src_out.amount = src_in.amount;
1569    src_out.global_index = src_in.outputs.at(src_in.real_output_in_tx_index).first;
1570    src_out.rct = src_in.rct;
1571    src_out.pubkey = epee::string_tools::pod_to_hex(
1572                        src_in.outputs.at(src_in.real_output_in_tx_index).second);
```

The struct definition documents the meaning, and the serialiser only bounds `real_output`, not `real_output_in_tx_index`:

```cpp
// src/cryptonote_core/cryptonote_tx_utils.h
45  std::vector<output_entry> outputs;     // index + key + ringct commitment (the RING)
46  uint64_t real_output;                  // index in `outputs` of the real entry
49  uint64_t real_output_in_tx_index;      // index in the SOURCE TX's vout
...
68    if (real_output >= outputs.size())   // serialiser only enforces this one
69      return false;
```

Other callers all use `real_output`:

```cpp
// src/cryptonote_core/cryptonote_tx_utils.cpp:365
const auto& out_key = src_entr.outputs[src_entr.real_output].second.dest;
// src/multisig/multisig_tx_builder_ringct.cpp:113
rct::rct2pk(src.outputs[src.real_output].second.dest),
// src/simplewallet/simplewallet.cpp:6213
if (src.outputs[src.real_output].second.dest == td.get_public_key())
```

And `wallet2::transfer_selected_rct` is what populates the two fields in the first place, so you can see them being assigned to clearly different things:

```cpp
// src/wallet/wallet2.cpp:9985–9992
*it_to_replace = real_oe;
src.real_out_tx_key             = get_tx_pub_key_from_extra(td.m_tx, td.m_pk_index);
src.real_out_additional_tx_keys = get_additional_tx_pub_keys_from_extra(td.m_tx);
src.real_output                 = it_to_replace - src.outputs.begin();   // ring slot
src.real_output_in_tx_index     = td.m_internal_output_index;             // source-tx vout index
```

There's a second, smaller failure mode falling out of the same line. Because `real_output_in_tx_index` isn't bounded by `outputs.size()`, an unsigned txset whose source UTXO came from a tx with more than `ring_size` outputs (batched payouts, miner consolidations) makes `outputs.at(real_output_in_tx_index)` throw `std::out_of_range`. The catch a few frames up converts that into `WALLET_RPC_ERROR_CODE_BAD_UNSIGNED_TX_DATA "failed to parse unsigned transfers"`. The same blob signs and broadcasts cleanly via `sign_transfer` / `submit_transfer` — only the review path is broken. Operators who rely on `describe_transfer` to gate signing on legitimate batched txsets get a hard fail with a misleading error message.

## Releases Affected

`master @ 082b600a2` and the `release-v0.18` branch (the two lines are byte-identical there). The describe path lands in tree well before the current top commits — this isn't a regression from a single PR. The Ubuntu `monero` package ships the same handler.

## Steps to Reproduce

I packaged the entire repro as a self-contained bash script that drives the unmodified upstream binaries built from `/home/beni/Monero/monero-src`. It uses no mocks, no patches, no test harness — just a real `monerod --regtest --offline` and two `monero-wallet-rpc` instances on loopback.

**Prerequisites — build once:**

```bash
cd /home/beni/Monero/monero-src
mkdir -p build/release && cd build/release
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
      -D MONERO_WALLET_CRYPTO_LIBRARY=cn -D ARCH=native \
      -D MANUAL_SUBMODULES=1 ../..
make -j$(nproc)
# Binaries land at build/release/bin/{monerod,monero-wallet-rpc}
```

The script checks for those binaries at startup and exits with an error if they're missing. It also `grep`s the buggy lines out of the source tree before doing anything else, so reviewers can confirm the binary they're about to run was compiled from those exact lines.

**Run (~90 s):**

```
bash reports/poc_describe_transfer_wrong_ring_index.sh
```

What it does:

1. Starts `monerod --regtest --fixed-difficulty 1 --offline` on loopback.
2. Spins up `wallet_a` (full / cold) on RPC `:18190`. Mines 80 blocks to it, then 60 buffer blocks elsewhere so the outputs unlock.
3. Captures `wallet_a`'s UTXO ledger via `incoming_transfers`. That's the ground truth — for every output the wallet owns, we now have the `(key_image, global_index, pubkey)` triple.
4. Spins up `wallet_b` (watch-only of `wallet_a`) on RPC `:18191` via `generate_from_keys` with viewkey + address only. Refreshes. Imports key images so it knows what's unspent.
5. `wallet_b` calls `transfer` with `do_not_relay=true`. Because it's watch-only, `fill_response` returns the cold-signing blob in `unsigned_txset`. That's the same blob a cold operator would receive in a real flow.
6. `wallet_a` calls `describe_transfer` on the unsigned txset. We capture each `sources[i].global_index` and `sources[i].pubkey`.
7. `wallet_a` calls `sign_transfer` on the same blob. `wallet_b` calls `submit_transfer` to relay it. We mine one block.
8. We pull the on-chain tx from the daemon (`get_transactions`, `decode_as_json=true`), read `vin[i].k_image` for each input, and look each one up in step 3's UTXO ledger. That gives the truth for every input: which `global_index`, which `pubkey`.
9. Per-input compare against describe.

  source[0] amount=35184338534400  →  MATCHES  (real_output happened to == real_output_in_tx_index)

    TRUTH    : GI=0           pubkey=2a0e7912bf34820cbfd9221f351b82aa…
  source[1] amount=35179037333548  →  *** MISMATCH ***   (BUG TRIGGERED)
    describe : GI=0      dest_pubkey=2a0e7912bf34820cbfd9221f351b82aa…

  [PASS] *** BUG CONFIRMED *** — 1 of 2 input(s) misreported by describe_transfer
```

Note what describe says about source[1]: `global_index=0, pubkey=2a0e7912…`. That's identical to source[0]. Both sources came from coinbase txs (one output each, so `real_output_in_tx_index=0` on both), so the buggy line pulls `outputs[0]` from each ring; describe ends up reporting two ring decoys that look almost interchangeable. The actual broadcast tx (`txid=7e1ba85c…`) spent `global_index=79` on that input — pubkey `387dced4…` — which is nowhere in the description an operator would have seen.

If you want to do it by hand instead of via the script, the four core RPC calls are:

```bash
# 1) wallet_b (watch-only) — produce the unsigned txset
TX=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18191/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"transfer",
  "params":{"destinations":[{"amount":1000000000000,"address":"<DEST>"}],
            "account_index":0,"priority":1,"ring_size":11,"do_not_relay":true}}')
UTX=$(echo "$TX" | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["unsigned_txset"])')

# 2) wallet_a (full) — describe it BEFORE signing
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18190/json_rpc \
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":\"0\",\"method\":\"describe_transfer\",
       \"params\":{\"unsigned_txset\":\"$UTX\"}}" \
  | jq '.result.desc[0].sources[] | {amount,global_index,pubkey}'         # ← BUGGY OUTPUT

# 3) wallet_a — sign; wallet_b — submit
SIGNED=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18190/json_rpc \
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":\"0\",\"method\":\"sign_transfer\",
       \"params\":{\"unsigned_txset\":\"$UTX\"}}" \
  | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["signed_txset"])')
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18191/json_rpc \
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":\"0\",\"method\":\"submit_transfer\",
       \"params\":{\"tx_data_hex\":\"$SIGNED\"}}"

# 4) Daemon — pull the on-chain tx, read its real vin[i].k_image
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:38181/get_transactions \
  -d "{\"txs_hashes\":[\"<TX_HASH>\"],\"decode_as_json\":true}" \
  | jq '.txs[0].as_json | fromjson | .vin[].key.k_image'                  # ← TRUTH
```
{F5885192}
{F5885193}
{F5885194}
{F5885195}
The `truth.tsv` artefact the script writes makes the per-input mapping easy to read; the raw `describe_transfer.json` and `get_transactions.json` are saved next to it under `/tmp/lab_describe_transfer_bug/`.

## Possible Solution

One-line fix — use the field whose name actually means what we want:

```diff
-        src_out.global_index = src_in.outputs.at(src_in.real_output_in_tx_index).first;
+        src_out.global_index = src_in.outputs.at(src_in.real_output).first;
         src_out.rct = src_in.rct;
-        src_out.pubkey = epee::string_tools::pod_to_hex(src_in.outputs.at(src_in.real_output_in_tx_index).second);
+        src_out.pubkey = epee::string_tools::pod_to_hex(src_in.outputs.at(src_in.real_output).second);
```

A couple of defence-in-depth notes while you're there:

- Add an explicit guard before the lookup. The serialiser already rejects `real_output >= outputs.size()`, but a future change there shouldn't be the only thing standing between this RPC and an OOB read:
  ```cpp
  THROW_WALLET_EXCEPTION_IF(src_in.real_output >= src_in.outputs.size(),
      error::wallet_internal_error, "real_output out of bounds");
  ```
- It would be nice to add `real_output` itself to the response. Operators who keep their own UTXO ledger could then sanity-check the chosen ring slot independently, instead of having to trust `global_index` and `pubkey` blindly.
- The current test fixtures don't catch this because they tend to have `real_output == real_output_in_tx_index == 0`. A unit test where the two diverge — easy to construct from `transfer_selected_rct` output — would have caught it.

## Impact

`describe_transfer` is the cold-wallet pre-sign review primitive. When the unsigned txset comes from a side the operator doesn't fully trust — a compromised view-only wallet, a malicious co-signer, a payment-processor integration — the operator's only defence is to call this RPC and read what it says before hitting `sign_transfer`. Today that defence doesn't work: the description does not describe the real input.

A hostile builder who produces the unsigned txset can put a benign-looking ring decoy in the slot the bug picks (`outputs[real_output_in_tx_index]`). For UTXOs derived from coinbase or any source tx whose real output sits at `vout[0]`, that's `outputs[0]` of the ring — the lowest-global-index decoy after sort, which to a reviewer looks like an ordinary entry. Nothing in the rest of `on_describe_transfer` notices the substitution: the change-handling sanity checks at line 1590 onward only constrain change destinations, not source identity. The reviewer signs. The actual signed transaction (built from `outputs[real_output]`, untouched) burns the real output that was hidden from the description.

The same defect quietly denies pre-sign review for legitimate batched-payout txsets where the real output's source tx had more than `ring_size` outputs. `outputs.at(real_output_in_tx_index)` throws, the catch returns `WALLET_RPC_ERROR_CODE_BAD_UNSIGNED_TX_DATA "failed to parse unsigned transfers"`, the operator can't review it, but `sign_transfer` and `submit_transfer` accept and broadcast the same blob without complaint.

## Note

The PoC script `reports/poc_describe_transfer_wrong_ring_index.sh` and this write-up were iterated with editor/AI help for the regtest plumbing and shell wiring. The buggy lines, the index semantics in `tx_source_entry`, and the on-chain ground-truth comparison were checked by reading the source and the captured RPC responses against the tree at `082b600a2`. The script `grep`s the buggy lines from the source tree at startup, so anyone re-running it can confirm the binary it's exercising was compiled from those lines.
