# Q0925: get_cf charges far less than it costs (blockstore_db.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `get_cf` in `ledger/src/blockstore_db.rs` with an index range the attacker can grow without bound, and make the real CPU/memory cost of `get_cf` exceed the units charged for it, so that the invariant "Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `ledger/src/blockstore_db.rs` -> `get_cf()` (around line 344)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an index range the attacker can grow without bound
- Exploit idea: Find the input shape where `get_cf`'s real CPU/memory/IO cost grows much faster than the compute units or fee charged for it.
- Invariant to test: Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Measure real time/allocations versus units charged across input sizes; assert cost/CU ratio stays bounded.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply force sigverify, dedup, scheduling, or buffering work that vastly exceeds the fees ever collected, degrading the leader below true cost.
