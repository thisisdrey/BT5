# Q2993: get_sysvar_obj is not deterministic across nodes (sysvar_cache.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `get_sysvar_obj` in `program-runtime/src/sysvar_cache.rs` with a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one, and make the serialized account layout handed to the program disagree with the layout the deserializer assumes on return, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `get_sysvar_obj` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/sysvar_cache.rs` -> `get_sysvar_obj()` (around line 130)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one
- Exploit idea: Find input to `get_sysvar_obj` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `get_sysvar_obj` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `get_sysvar_obj` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
