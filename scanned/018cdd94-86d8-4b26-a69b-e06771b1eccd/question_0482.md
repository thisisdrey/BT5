# Q0482: get-egroup via collateral-remove-redeem: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `min-underlying`, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, so the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `min-underlying` varied, and assert that the value `get-egroup` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
