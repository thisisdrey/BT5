# Q3914: Smart account deployment and initialization: duplicate entries / unexpected privilege / predictability

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays while the factory is deploying a brand-new Safe through the standard proxy path and make duplicate or crafted initializer arrays install more delegate or allowance surface than intended, breaking the rule that the predicted address for a given deployer, nonce, and initializer should match exactly one controllable deployment outcome and leading to Bypass of intended Safe initialization or module-setup permissions?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays
- Exploit idea: make duplicate or crafted initializer arrays install more delegate or allowance surface than intended
- Invariant to test: the predicted address for a given deployer, nonce, and initializer should match exactly one controllable deployment outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended Safe initialization or module-setup permissions
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated delegatecall attempts into `configureSmartAccount` and assert the one-shot guard holds in every reachable context.
