# Q2295: subset via liquidate: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) tests bitmask containment. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `subset` touches, run `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
