# Q5870: convert-to-scaled-debt via liquidate-multi: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch varied, and assert that the value `convert-to-scaled-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
