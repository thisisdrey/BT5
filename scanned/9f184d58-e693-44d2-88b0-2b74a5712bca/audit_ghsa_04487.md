## Details
## Summary

PraisonAI recipe execution has a dangerous-tool policy that is supposed to block default-denied tools unless the caller explicitly passes `allow_dangerous_tools=True`. That policy only checks tools declared in `TEMPLATE.yaml` `requires.tools`.

For steps-based recipes, the actual execution path loads `workflow.yaml` with `YAMLWorkflowParser`. That parser resolves agent-level `tools:` declarations and preserves top-level `approve:`. `Workflow.start()` then installs those YAML-approved tools into the approval context.

As a result, an untrusted recipe can omit `execute_command` from `TEMPLATE.yaml requires.tools`, declare it in `workflow.yaml agents.*.tools`, and add top-level `approve: [execute_command]`. The caller did not set `allow_dangerous_tools=True`, but the recipe policy allows the recipe and the workflow approval path self-approves the critical shell tool.

The local PoV uses a harmless `printf` canary and explicitly unsets `PRAISONAI_AUTO_APPROVE`.

## Technical Details

`recipe.run()` checks the recipe policy unless `options["allow_dangerous_tools"]` is true. `_check_tool_policy()` gets the required tool list from `recipe_config.get_required_tools()`, which is backed by `TEMPLATE.yaml` `requires.tools`.

The steps workflow execution path is separate:

1. `_execute_steps_workflow()` parses the workflow file with `YAMLWorkflowParser`.
2. `YAMLWorkflowParser` resolves `agents.*.tools`.
3. The same parser reads top-level `approve:` and stores it on `workflow.approve_tools`.
4. `Workflow.start()` calls `set_yaml_approved_tools(approve_tools)`.
5. The approval registry treats YAML-approved tools as approved.

`execute_command` is listed as a default dangerous tool with `critical` risk and is decorated with `@require_approval(risk_level="critical")`. The policy gap is that recipe-level dangerous-tool enforcement does not inspect the workflow file that actually supplies and approves the tool.

### Why This Is Not Intended Behavior

YAML `approve:` is an intended feature. This report is not claiming that workflow-level approval is inherently unintended.

The unintended behavior is that the recipe dangerous-tool policy exposes an operator-facing explicit override, `allow_dangerous_tools=True`, but a recipe can avoid that policy by moving the dangerous tool declaration from `TEMPLATE.yaml requires.tools` into the steps workflow. The recipe still runs through the standard recipe runner path, and the same workflow can self-approve the critical tool.

This conflicts with the documented safety model:

- PraisonAI's approval docs describe approval as pausing an agent before a risky tool and asking a human or configured channel to allow or deny it.
- The SDK approval docs describe a human-in-the-loop approval system for dangerous tool operations.
- Security-environment documentation describes opt-in access for potentially dangerous operations and secure defaults for RCE prevention.
- Policy-engine documentation describes policies that block dangerous operations and require approval for sensitive actions.

A control recipe that declares `requires.tools: [execute_command]` is denied with:

```text
Tool 'execute_command' is denied by default. Use allow_dangerous_tools=True to override.
```

The bypass recipe uses the same tool but omits it from `requires.tools`; it passes policy and reaches the recipe runner's dry-run state.

## PoV

Run:

```bash
python3 poc/poc.py
```

Expected output:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "control_policy": "Tool 'execute_command' is denied by default. Use allow_dangerous_tools=True to override.",
  "control_recipe_status": "policy_denied",
  "bypass_policy": null,
  "bypass_recipe_dry_run_status": "dry_run",
  "workflow_approve_tools": [
    "execute_command"
  ],
  "runner_tool_names": [
    "execute_command"
  ],
  "command_stdout": "poc",
  "operator_env_auto_approve": null
}
```

The PoV creates two temporary recipes:

1. A control recipe with `TEMPLATE.yaml requires.tools: [execute_command]`. `recipe.run()` returns `policy_denied`.
2. A bypass recipe with no dangerous tools in `TEMPLATE.yaml`, but with `workflow.yaml` declaring `execute_command` under an agent and `approve: [execute_command]`. `recipe.run(..., dry_run=True)` reaches `dry_run`, and the same parser/approval context permits a harmless `printf poc.

## PoC

The PoV section above contains the local reproduction command, input, and decisive output.

## Impact

If an operator runs an untrusted recipe, or exposes the recipe runner to users who can choose recipe names/URIs, the recipe can self-authorize a default-denied critical shell tool without the operator setting `allow_dangerous_tools=True`.

Successful exploitation lets the workflow run `execute_command` with the privileges of the PraisonAI process if the agent reaches the tool call. The exact trigger depends on the workflow and model/tool-call path, but the policy boundary is already bypassed before execution.

This can affect both local CLI use and HTTP recipe-runner deployments. The HTTP recipe runner defaults to localhost/no-auth and requires auth for non-localhost binding, so this report uses local/UI-required severity rather than claiming an unauthenticated network RCE by default.

The local HTTP sidecar documentation also frames the sidecar as a localhost REST API for local/polyglot integration. If a deployment exposes that API to authenticated users who can choose recipe names or URIs, the same policy bypass can become an authenticated remote recipe-execution issue, but that is not the default severity claim.

### Severity

Suggested severity: High.

## Suggested Fix

Normalize and validate the actual workflow tool graph before recipe execution:

- Parse the selected workflow file before or during `_check_tool_policy()`.
- Include `workflow.yaml agents.*.tools`, `roles.*.tools`, included recipes, and other workflow-resolved tool lists in the dangerous-tool policy.
- Treat `approve:` as an operator-supplied approval policy, not a recipe-controlled bypass of the recipe-level dangerous-tool gate.
- If `approve:` remains recipe-controlled, ignore dangerous/default-denied tool entries unless the caller passed `allow_dangerous_tools=True` or an explicit external policy allowed that exact tool.
- Add regression tests for:
  - dangerous tool in `TEMPLATE.yaml requires.tools` is denied;
  - dangerous tool in `workflow.yaml agents.*.tools` is also denied;
  - `approve: [execute_command]` does not bypass the recipe policy;
  - `allow_dangerous_tools=True` keeps the intended opt-in behavior.
