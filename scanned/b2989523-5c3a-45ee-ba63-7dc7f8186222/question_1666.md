# Q1666: debt-preview via accrue: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the utilization the rate is interpolated at, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `accrue` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
