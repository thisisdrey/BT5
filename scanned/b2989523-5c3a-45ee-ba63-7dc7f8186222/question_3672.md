# Q3672: calc-liq-factor-exp via liquidate: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-collateral-expected` reach `calc-liq-factor-exp` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:708) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it uses `(/ exp BPS)` as an integer exponent for `pow` and falls back to `sqrti` below BPS, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:708` -> `calc-liq-factor-exp`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-exp` uses `(/ exp BPS)` as an integer exponent for `pow` and falls back to `sqrti` below BPS. Reach it through `liquidate` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-collateral-expected` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-factor-exp` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
