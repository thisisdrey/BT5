# Q0611: Loans funding and disbursement state: batch neighbor / wrong investor pull / no stale owner

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with one target loan plus a nearby loan in a different lifecycle phase that the attacker also controls while the NFT has been approved, listed, cancelled, or transferred shortly before the funding call and make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan, breaking the rule that a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch and leading to Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: one target loan plus a nearby loan in a different lifecycle phase that the attacker also controls
- Exploit idea: make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan
- Invariant to test: a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC
- Fast validation: Forge test ownership changes, lock cycles, and standing allowances around `fund`, then assert only the current NFT owner can move capital exactly once.
