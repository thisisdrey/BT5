# Q3466: imt - DepositMessage untagged/flatten parsing picks the wrong action (3)

## Question
Given the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_on_transfer` / `nft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` from a token contract the attacker wrote, craft a deposit `msg` whose JSON matches both `DepositAction::Execute` and `DepositAction::Notify` under `#[serde(untagged)]` + `#[serde(flatten)]`, so `ImtMint` in `contracts/defuse/core/src/intents/imt.rs` selects a different action than the depositor intended, breaking the invariant `the `DepositAction` executed == the action the depositor's serialised message unambiguously denotes` and leading to direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/core/src/intents/imt.rs](contracts/defuse/core/src/intents/imt.rs) - `ImtMint` (cross-check `ImtBurn` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_on_transfer` / `nft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` from a token contract the attacker wrote
- Attacker controls: `sender_id`, `amount`, the `msg` (receiver, notify, or nested intents), and the token's own behaviour
- Exploit idea: `untagged` tries variants in order; a message containing both `execute_intents` and `msg` fields, or neither in canonical form, resolves ambiguously. Set-up: the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value.
- Invariant to test: the `DepositAction` executed == the action the depositor's serialised message unambiguously denotes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation
- Fast validation: Round-trip ambiguous `DepositMessage` JSON; assert exactly one variant matches or parsing fails.
