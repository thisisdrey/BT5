# Q3721: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: nft route / route widening / per-safe route binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances while the route exists with a current positive allowance or a current NFT blanket approval and spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe, breaking the rule that delegate rights and allowances should bind to one exact `(safe, token-or-collection, recipient)` route only and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances
- Exploit idea: spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe
- Invariant to test: delegate rights and allowances should bind to one exact `(safe, token-or-collection, recipient)` route only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping
- Fast validation: Check that neighboring recipients, collections, or tokens cannot be reached through a superficially similar approved route.
