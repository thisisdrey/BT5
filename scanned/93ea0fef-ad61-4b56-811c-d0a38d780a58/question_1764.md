# Q1764: Exchange offer lifecycle: relist cycle / stale snapshot / exact counterparties

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled cancellation and re-listing cycles for the same loans while the offer contains multiple loans whose economic state can diverge while storage stays static and make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way, breaking the rule that mutual investor-registration checks should bind the exact buyer and seller that receive settlement value and leading to Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled cancellation and re-listing cycles for the same loans
- Exploit idea: make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way
- Invariant to test: mutual investor-registration checks should bind the exact buyer and seller that receive settlement value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement
- Fast validation: Simulate cancel/relist cycles and ensure no listed loan remains locked or economically bound to a dead offer.
