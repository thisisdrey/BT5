# Q0591: Loans funding and disbursement state: batch neighbor / epoch confusion / no stale owner

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with one target loan plus a nearby loan in a different lifecycle phase that the attacker also controls while the loan is still `Created` with positive borrower principal receivable and zero investor principal payable and make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions, breaking the rule that a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: one target loan plus a nearby loan in a different lifecycle phase that the attacker also controls
- Exploit idea: make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions
- Invariant to test: a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement
- Fast validation: Assert that any failed disbursement or replay attempt reverts without leaving priceable or withdrawable balances behind.
