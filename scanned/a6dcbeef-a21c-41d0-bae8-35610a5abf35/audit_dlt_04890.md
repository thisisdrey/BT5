# `buyPosition` - seller takes extra amount when `msg.value > sellOrder.price`

## Summary

during `buyPosition` - buyer send eth . This eth is sent to maker.
This is done even if the sent eth is greater than the price value.

## Vulnerability Detail
maker will take more price than the actual value. Buyer will incur unnecessary loss.

        if (msg.value > 0) {
            // Buyer could send more ETH than asked
            require(msg.value >= sellOrder.price, "INVALID_ETH_VALUE");
            require(sellOrder.asset == weth, "INCOMPATIBLE_ASSET_ETH_VALUE");


            WETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();
            IERC20(weth).safeTransfer(sellOrder.maker, msg.value);

in above line of code, The check is done to ensure the ETH value is greater than the `sellOrder.price`

If the sent ETH is greater than sellOrder.price, then this extra eth also sent to maker. imo, this is not fair.

## Impact

maker will take more price than the actual `sellOrder.price`. Buyer will incur unnecessary loss.
