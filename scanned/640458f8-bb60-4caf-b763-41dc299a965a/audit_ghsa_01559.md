# [M] Command injection in codecov (npm package)

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-xp63-6vf5-xf3v
CVE: CVE-2020-15123
CWE: CWE-78
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2020-07-20
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xp63-6vf5-xf3v
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- npm: `codecov` — affected >=0 <3.7.1

## Details
### Impact

The `upload` method has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the `codecov-node` library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability.

A similar CVE was issued: [CVE-2020-7597](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh), but the fix was incomplete. It only blocked `&`, and command injection is still possible using backticks instead to bypass the sanitizer.

We have written a [CodeQL](https://codeql.com) query, which automatically detects this vulnerability. You can see the results of the query on the `codecov-node` project [here](https://lgtm.com/query/7714424068617023832/).


### Patches
This has been patched in version 3.7.1

### Workarounds

None, however, the attack surface is low in this case. Particularly in the standard use of codecov, where the module is used directly in a build pipeline, not built against as a library in another application that may supply malicious input and perform command injection.
