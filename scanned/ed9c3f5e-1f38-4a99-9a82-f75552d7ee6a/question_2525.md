# Q2525: notify_slot_rooted is not deterministic across nodes (slot_status_notifier.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `notify_slot_rooted` in `rpc/src/slot_status_notifier.rs` with an empty or single-element set at the boundary of the accumulation, and make the transaction status recorded at commit disagree with the status returned by the status query, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `notify_slot_rooted` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/slot_status_notifier.rs` -> `notify_slot_rooted()` (around line 14)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: an empty or single-element set at the boundary of the accumulation
- Exploit idea: Find input to `notify_slot_rooted` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `notify_slot_rooted` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `notify_slot_rooted` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
