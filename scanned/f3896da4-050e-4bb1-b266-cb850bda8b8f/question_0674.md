# Q0674: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: exact amount / clearing mismatch / entitlement isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with exact payment sizes and timestamps across repeated borrower-controlled pay calls while an investor or vault cashflow collection could run soon after the borrower payment and make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes, breaking the rule that a borrower should not be able to distort another user's principal or interest entitlements just by timing ordinary payments and leading to Cross-user exploit window against NAV-sensitive vault operations?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: exact payment sizes and timestamps across repeated borrower-controlled pay calls
- Exploit idea: make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes
- Invariant to test: a borrower should not be able to distort another user's principal or interest entitlements just by timing ordinary payments
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user exploit window against NAV-sensitive vault operations
- Fast validation: Model a vault-held loan, have the borrower pay just before NAV-sensitive approvals, and assert no stale-price claim becomes possible.
