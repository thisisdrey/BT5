# Q3132: Address-book role bit isolation: mutual whitelist / whitelist bypass / exact whitelist

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits while the canonical `address(this)` book and a self-managed book both contain related addresses and make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present, breaking the rule that loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book and leading to Loans NFT or cashflow rights entering an unauthorized counterparty context?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits
- Exploit idea: make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present
- Invariant to test: loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT or cashflow rights entering an unauthorized counterparty context
- Fast validation: Check that mixed legitimate multi-role grantees do not accidentally satisfy unrelated authorization checks.
