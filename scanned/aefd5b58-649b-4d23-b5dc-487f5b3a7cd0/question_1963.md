# Q1963: Vault async deposit flow: split parties / price-lock break / approved price

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses while the controller already has a prior claimable deposit or pending redeem position and make the shares claimed exceed the approval-time price lock for the same controller, breaking the rule that approved deposit shares should never exceed assets * totalSupply / approvalNAV for that exact approval epoch and leading to Accounting issue in the vault leading to underbacked claimable shares?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: make the shares claimed exceed the approval-time price lock for the same controller
- Invariant to test: approved deposit shares should never exceed assets * totalSupply / approvalNAV for that exact approval epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in the vault leading to underbacked claimable shares
- Fast validation: Assert that direct operator churn around request and claim never changes who can consume a controller's approved value.
