# Q5423: unpack-u16 via redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `recipient`, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `recipient`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
