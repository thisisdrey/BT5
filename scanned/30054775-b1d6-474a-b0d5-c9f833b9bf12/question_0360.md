# Q0360: remove-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position state the final collateral-add is validated against across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `remove-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
