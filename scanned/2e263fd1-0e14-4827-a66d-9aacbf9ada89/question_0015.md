# Q0015: Loans create authorization: self-book spoof / toxic loan seed / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with only a self-curated address book plus attacker-controlled borrower, investor, and servicer addresses while the canonical address book already contains at least one genuinely approved originator and seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate, breaking the rule that borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution once the unauthorized loan enters normal funding and withdrawal flows?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: only a self-curated address book plus attacker-controlled borrower, investor, and servicer addresses
- Exploit idea: seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate
- Invariant to test: borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution once the unauthorized loan enters normal funding and withdrawal flows
- Fast validation: Check that no combination of overlapping role addresses or registration churn lets `create` mint a usable loan NFT without canonical approval.
