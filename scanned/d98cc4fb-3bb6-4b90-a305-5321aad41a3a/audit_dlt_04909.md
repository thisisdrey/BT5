# Users can avoid paying fees

## Summary
Fee is calculated via the `matchOrder ()` function based on the `order.collateral` and `order.premium` deposited by both the bull and the bear as shown in the `matchOrder ()` function as seen here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L306-L368.
Interestingly, when matching orders, the contract does not prevent the order Maker to be the same as the order Taker. As such, a user can create an order and be the same person that matches the same order. With this, it is possible to make an order that requires either `0` `order.premium` or 0 `order.collateral`. With this, you would only pay fee for either of the two and not both. Thereafter, create a `sellOrder` of the matched contract position and sell the contract position. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is the fact that the contract Maker can become the contract Taker. The following Test case modified from the `BatchMatchOrders` as shown below proves this. 
```solidity 
function testMatchSeveralOrders() public {
        BvbProtocol.Order memory order = defaultOrder();
        bytes32 orderHash = bvb.hashOrder(order);

        BvbProtocol.Order memory secondOrder = defaultOrder();
        secondOrder.isBull = false;
        bytes32 secondOrderHash = bvb.hashOrder(secondOrder);

        bytes memory signature = signOrder(bullPrivateKey, order);
        bytes memory secondSignature = signOrder(bullPrivateKey, secondOrder);

        BvbProtocol.Order[] memory orders = new BvbProtocol.Order[](2);
        orders[0] = order;
        assertEq(order.collateral, 0, "Assert order collateral is 0");
        orders[1] = secondOrder;
        bytes[] memory signatures = new bytes[](2);
        signatures[0] = signature;
        signatures[1] = secondSignature;
        vm.prank(bull);

        bvb.batchMatchOrders(orders, signatures);

        assertEq(bvb.bulls(uint(orderHash)), bull, "Bvb correctly saved the bull for the first order");
        assertEq(bvb.bears(uint(orderHash)), bull, "Bvb correctly saved the bear for the first order");
```
As such, a user can create an order with either `0` collateral or that requires `0` premium and thereafter create a `sellOrder` for the position.
