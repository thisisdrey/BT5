# Q0514: Loans funding and disbursement state: role handoff / wrong investor pull / exact commitment

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call while the loan is still `Created` with positive borrower principal receivable and zero investor principal payable and make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan, breaking the rule that the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan and leading to Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call
- Exploit idea: make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan
- Invariant to test: the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC
- Fast validation: Forge test ownership changes, lock cycles, and standing allowances around `fund`, then assert only the current NFT owner can move capital exactly once.
