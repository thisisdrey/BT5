# Q0128: Loans create authorization: originator mismatch / toxic loan seed / downstream safety

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with a fake `originator` parameter that names another address while the attacker remains `msg.sender` while a victim investor or vault could later interact with the created loan through funding, withdrawal, or pricing flows and seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate, breaking the rule that an unprivileged caller should never be able to create a loan whose later funding, withdrawal, or pricing can touch another user without a real originator approval and leading to Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: a fake `originator` parameter that names another address while the attacker remains `msg.sender`
- Exploit idea: seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate
- Invariant to test: an unprivileged caller should never be able to create a loan whose later funding, withdrawal, or pricing can touch another user without a real originator approval
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user
- Fast validation: Forge test a caller with only self-book registrations and assert `create` cannot succeed unless the canonical originator book explicitly approves the caller.
