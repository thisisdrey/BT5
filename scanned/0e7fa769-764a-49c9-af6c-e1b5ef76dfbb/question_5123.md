# Q5123: debt-remove-scaled via transfer: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `transfer` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `transfer` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
