# Q2680: Vault NAV freshness and cross-contract state: external buyout / stale ledger / no stale claims

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower, investor, buyer, seller, or shareholder interacting through ordinary protocol entrypoints enter through `Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals` with acceptance timing for a vault-created sale offer by an attacker-controlled designated buyer while the affected loan is in or near the curated `_navLoanIds` set used for pricing and make a user-controlled entitlement or cashflow change create a price-sensitive stale-state window across approvals, breaking the rule that an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through stale NAV approvals?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / _requireFreshNav, updateNav, collectCashflows, fundLoans, createSaleOffer, acceptSaleOffer
- Entrypoint: Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals
- Attacker controls: acceptance timing for a vault-created sale offer by an attacker-controlled designated buyer
- Exploit idea: make a user-controlled entitlement or cashflow change create a price-sensitive stale-state window across approvals
- Invariant to test: an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through stale NAV approvals
- Fast validation: Fuzz ownershipNonce-changing actions around `_requireFreshNav` and ensure every priced approval sees the latest holdings epoch.
