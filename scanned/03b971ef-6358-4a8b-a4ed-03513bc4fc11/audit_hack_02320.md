# [M] \[M01\] Governance can be tricked into performing external calls to a malicious contract

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Source: https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/bf9753ef9cd5b17236036257f290e0d0b850a029/protocol/contracts/src/incentivizer/Incentivizer.sol#L35
Type: audit-issue

## Details
The [Incentivizer contract](https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/bf9753ef9cd5b17236036257f290e0d0b850a029/protocol/contracts/src/incentivizer/Incentivizer.sol#L35) allows the protocol to give rewards to users that stake underlying assets.

In case of having unused assets by the `Incentivizer` contract, the governance can call the [rescue function](https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/bf9753ef9cd5b17236036257f290e0d0b850a029/protocol/contracts/src/incentivizer/Incentivizer.sol#L176) transferring those into the [reserve](https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/bf9753ef9cd5b17236036257f290e0d0b850a029/protocol/contracts/src/reserve/ReserveImpl.sol#L31).

However, this opens a backdoor which a malicious user could exploit. An user could create a malicious contract that simulates to be a ERC20 compliant token that deposits tokens in the `Incentivizer` contract, and when the governance passes a proposal to rescue those tokens and send them into the reserve, an [external call to the malicious contract will be executed](https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/bf9753ef9cd5b17236036257f290e0d0b850a029/protocol/contracts/src/incentivizer/Incentivizer.sol#L179) without checks on the other end.

Furthermore, once received into the reserve, the governance could [create an order to swap](https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/bf9753ef9cd5b17236036257f290e0d0b850a029/protocol/contracts/src/reserve/ReserveSwapper.sol#L57) them and when the attacker makes the call to the `swap` function from the `ReserveSwapper` contract, the [malicious external call would now be originated](https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/bf9753ef9cd5b17236036257f290e0d0b850a029/protocol/contracts/src/reserve/ReserveSwapper.sol#L87) from the reserve.

Although the contract is shielded by the [OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard contract](https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/bf9753ef9cd5b17236036257f290e0d0b850a029/protocol/contracts/src/reserve/ReserveSwapper.sol#L23) and no funds cannot be moved with this attack, reducing the attack surface on the code, and specially on contracts that handle the assets such as the `ReserveSwapper` and the `Incentivizer` contracts, is always recommendable to prevent that future versions of the protocol could be affected by this attack.

Moreover, as discussed in the introduction, the `ReentrancyGuard` shield has been removed from the code while the audit was being performed.

Consider restricting the possibility to perform external calls to untrusted contracts to reduce the attack surfaces in the protocol.
