# Q0587: total-debt via accrue: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing the utilization the rate is interpolated at, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `accrue` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
