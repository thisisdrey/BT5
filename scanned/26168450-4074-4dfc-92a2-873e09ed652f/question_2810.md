# Q2810: debt-remove-scaled via collateral-remove: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, so the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) varied, and assert that the value `debt-remove-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
