## Details
# The provided code has an issue where it assumes the entire position is liquidatable, when only a portion may be closable.
## Summary
It assumes the entire position is liquidatable. However, the closable amount returned from _latest() may only be a portion of the overall position. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The _liquidate() function calls _liquidationFee() to get the liquidation fee and closable amount. _liquidationFee() in turn calls _latest() to get the latest position and closable amount.

However, _latest() only returns the portion of the overall position that is currently closable based on pending settlements. This closable amount may be less than the full position magnitude.

When _liquidate() is called, it passes the account's entire pending position from market.pendingPositions() to market.update(), not just the closable amount returned from _liquidationFee().

This means it could try to close more of the position than is actually closable, which would fail.

For example:

- Account has 10 DSU overall position
- Only 5 DSU are closable due to pending settlement
- _latest() returns 5 DSU closable amount
- _liquidate() tries to close the entire 10 DSU position
- This will fail as only 5 DSU can be closed
## Impact
The liquidation will fail if it tries to close more than the closable amount. Only the closable portion will be closed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
_liquidate() should close only the closable amount returned from _liquidationFee(), not the full pending position. This ensures it only closes the portion of the position that is actually closable.
