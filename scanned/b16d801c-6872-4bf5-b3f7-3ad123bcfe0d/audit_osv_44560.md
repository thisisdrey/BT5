# [M] HTTPX2: Quadratic SSE line buffering can cause CPU denial of service

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-84378
Aliases: GHSA-f2fp-rgf2-35cp, PYSEC-2026-3847
CVSS: 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2026-09-02
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-84378
Type: osv

## Details
HTTPX2 is a next generation HTTP client for Python. From 2.5.0 until 2.10.0, the HTTPX2 Server-Sent Events parser in src/httpx2/httpx2/_sse.py repeatedly copies and rescans buffered text in _SSELineDecoder.decode() when an attacker-controlled or compromised SSE endpoint splits one unterminated line across many response chunks. The behavior affects httpx2.Client.sse() and httpx2.AsyncClient.sse(), and the total processing work grows quadratically with the line length, allowing a crafted stream to consume excessive CPU and block a synchronous worker or asynchronous event loop. This issue is fixed in version 2.10.0.
