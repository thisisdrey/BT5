# Q3022: Address-book role bit isolation: zero-like target / stale auth residue / book isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with edge-case grantee addresses such as zero-like or contract addresses the attacker controls while a later `create` flow will read borrower, investor, or servicer bits from the chosen address book and make register/unregister churn leave a grantee usable in later flows after its intended role was supposedly removed, breaking the rule that a self-managed address book should never satisfy canonical-book checks or another owner's checks and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution after a wrong-role counterparty enters the lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: edge-case grantee addresses such as zero-like or contract addresses the attacker controls
- Exploit idea: make register/unregister churn leave a grantee usable in later flows after its intended role was supposedly removed
- Invariant to test: a self-managed address book should never satisfy canonical-book checks or another owner's checks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution after a wrong-role counterparty enters the lifecycle
- Fast validation: Model one self-managed book plus the canonical book and assert they can never substitute for each other.
