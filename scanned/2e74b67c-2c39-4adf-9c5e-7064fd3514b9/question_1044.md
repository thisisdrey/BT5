# Q1044: can_be_closed: freeze semantics can be bypassed through an alternate user flow [an-account-with-a-recently] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker bypass the intended freeze semantics by invoking `close_account` with an account with a recently executed order or liquidation state transition so `can_be_closed` still changes a blocked account, violating `closeability must require the full absence of live economic exposure, blocking flags, and value-bearing side state` and causing `High: permanent loss, stranding, or unauthorized release of live exposure`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `can_be_closed`
- Entrypoint: `close_account`
- Attacker controls: an account with a recently executed order or liquidation state transition
- Exploit idea: Audit alternate user flows that eventually touch the same balances but may not call the common frozen-account guard. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: closeability must require the full absence of live economic exposure, blocking flags, and value-bearing side state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent loss, stranding, or unauthorized release of live exposure
- Fast validation: Freeze the account, exercise alternate paths, and assert every value-moving route rejects before any state mutation occurs. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
