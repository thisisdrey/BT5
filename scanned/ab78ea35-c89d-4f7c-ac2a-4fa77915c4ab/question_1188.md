# Q1188: interpolate-rate via liquidate: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `borrower`, any third-party principal reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `liquidate` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `borrower`, any third-party principal across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `interpolate-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
