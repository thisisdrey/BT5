# Q4441: mod - refund_if_fails changes atomicity in the attacker's favour (8)

## Question
Given the named receiver account does not exist on chain, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through a `FtWithdraw` / `MtWithdraw` / `NftWithdraw` / `NativeWithdraw` / `StorageDeposit` / `AuthCall` intent inside `execute_intents`, exploit the `refund_if_fails` branch reached from `with_action` in `contracts/defuse/src/tokens/mod.rs`, which either calls `execute_intents` inline or schedules it as a detached promise, so a failure refunds the deposit while the intents still take effect, breaking the invariant `a deposit is refunded only when the intents it funded had no effect` and leading to direct theft of user funds: double settlement (assets delivered AND re-credited)?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/src/tokens/mod.rs](contracts/defuse/src/tokens/mod.rs) - `with_action` (cross-check `DepositMessage` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: a `FtWithdraw` / `MtWithdraw` / `NftWithdraw` / `NativeWithdraw` / `StorageDeposit` / `AuthCall` intent inside `execute_intents`
- Attacker controls: every field of the withdrawal intent, including `msg`, `min_gas`, `state_init` and `attached_deposit`
- Exploit idea: Inline execution shares the receipt; the detached `ext_intents::...detach()` path does not, so failure semantics differ between the two. Set-up: the named receiver account does not exist on chain.
- Invariant to test: a deposit is refunded only when the intents it funded had no effect
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds: double settlement (assets delivered AND re-credited)
- Fast validation: Sandbox both branches with a failing intent; assert deposit and effect are all-or-nothing.
