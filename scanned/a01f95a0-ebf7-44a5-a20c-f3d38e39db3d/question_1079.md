# Q1079: sync_indexer_flags: close path leaves live exposure behind [an-account-with-recently-opened] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker route `sync_indexer_flags` through `sync_indexer_flags` with an account with recently opened and closed orders so an account or balance is considered closable while live exposure still exists, breaking `synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly` and causing `Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `sync_indexer_flags`
- Entrypoint: `sync_indexer_flags`
- Attacker controls: an account with recently opened and closed orders
- Exploit idea: Check whether closeability is computed from stale flags, stale counts, or partial balance scans rather than the full economic state. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact
- Fast validation: Force the controlled residual state and assert close attempts fail until every active balance and obligation is actually gone. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
