# Q0411: Loans funding and disbursement state: fresh owner / phase skip / no stale owner

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a loan NFT that the attacker just acquired through a normal transfer or exchange settlement while status-like fields or off-chain expectations changed nearby but the economic balances still define the real state and make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable, breaking the rule that a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution between investor, borrower, and originator paths?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a loan NFT that the attacker just acquired through a normal transfer or exchange settlement
- Exploit idea: make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable
- Invariant to test: a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution between investor, borrower, and originator paths
- Fast validation: Forge test ownership changes, lock cycles, and standing allowances around `fund`, then assert only the current NFT owner can move capital exactly once.
