# Q0883: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: vault-held loan / clearing mismatch / cash-to-clearing consistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with payments into a loan currently owned by a vault that will later rely on NAV-sensitive approvals while a vault manager could update NAV or approve deposits/redemptions soon after the borrower payment and make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes, breaking the rule that the cash held after `pay` should always have a consistent representation in borrower payment clearing for that same loan and leading to Accounting issue in Loans ledger or Vault?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: payments into a loan currently owned by a vault that will later rely on NAV-sensitive approvals
- Exploit idea: make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes
- Invariant to test: the cash held after `pay` should always have a consistent representation in borrower payment clearing for that same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans ledger or Vault
- Fast validation: Fuzz payment sizes and timestamps around due dates and assert `lastPaymentDate`, clearing, and cash never enter a contradictory state.
