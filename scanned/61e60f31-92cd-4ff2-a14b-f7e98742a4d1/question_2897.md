# Q2897: Address-book role bit isolation: role reuse / bit confusion / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with the same attacker-controlled grantee registered under several Roles values in the same book while a later `createOffer` or `acceptOffer` flow will read the investor bit from both sides' books and make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role, breaking the rule that each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role and leading to Unauthorized loan creation or exchange settlement path through role confusion?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: the same attacker-controlled grantee registered under several Roles values in the same book
- Exploit idea: make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role
- Invariant to test: each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized loan creation or exchange settlement path through role confusion
- Fast validation: Fuzz register/unregister churn across roles and ensure no stale authorization survives in create or exchange flows.
