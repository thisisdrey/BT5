# Q5923: storage_deposit - wNEAR debited but NEAR never delivered (16)

## Question
Given the token contract is one the attacker deployed and can fail on demand, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_withdraw` / `nft_withdraw` / `mt_withdraw` called directly by an account with `auth_by_predecessor_id` enabled, make the `near_withdraw` unwrap or the follow-on call reached from `do_storage_deposit` in `contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/nep141/storage_deposit.rs` fail after the signer's wNEAR was already subtracted, with no refund path, breaking the invariant `wNEAR debited from an account == NEAR that reached the named receiver, or was returned to that account` and leading to permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/nep141/storage_deposit.rs](contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/nep141/storage_deposit.rs) - `do_storage_deposit` (cross-check `DO_STORAGE_DEPOSIT_GAS` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_withdraw` / `nft_withdraw` / `mt_withdraw` called directly by an account with `auth_by_predecessor_id` enabled
- Attacker controls: `token`, `receiver_id`, `amount`, `memo`, `msg`, `storage_deposit` and `min_gas`
- Exploit idea: `native_withdraw`, `storage_deposit`, deposit-bearing `auth_call` and `FtWithdraw::storage_deposit` all debit first and document that wNEAR is not refunded on failure. Set-up: the token contract is one the attacker deployed and can fail on demand.
- Invariant to test: wNEAR debited from an account == NEAR that reached the named receiver, or was returned to that account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)
- Fast validation: Point the receiver at a non-existent or reverting account; assert whether the wNEAR is recoverable.
