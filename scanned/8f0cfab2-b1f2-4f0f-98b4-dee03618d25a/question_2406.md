# Q2406: precursor and follow-up calls around dispatch can exploit intermediate state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker perform a user-controlled precursor call, then `dispatch`, then a user-controlled follow-up before cleanup completes, and profit from an intermediate inconsistent state?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/meta-tx/src/lib.rs::dispatch
- Entrypoint: public dispatch wrapper `dispatch`
- Attacker controls: proof or signed payload contents, nested call payloads, batched or wrapped execution context
- Exploit idea: Treat the entrypoint as the middle step of a public multi-call sequence rather than an isolated action.
- Invariant to test: Any intermediate state reachable between public calls must still satisfy the pallet's security invariants.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized code/call execution or theft from contract-controlled funds
- Fast validation: Search for a three-step sequence using only public calls and assert the middle state cannot be monetized or used to corrupt final settlement.
