# Q1202: total-assets-preview via supply-collateral-add: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to varied, and assert that the value `total-assets-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
