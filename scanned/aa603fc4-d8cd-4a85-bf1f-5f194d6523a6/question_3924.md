# Q3924: Smart account deployment and initialization: duplicate entries / init replay / ownership binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays while a second configuration attempt is made against a Safe that already ran initialization once and make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe, breaking the rule that deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold and leading to Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays
- Exploit idea: make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe
- Invariant to test: deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account
- Fast validation: Fuzz initializer arrays and duplicate entries, then assert the resulting Safe has exactly the declared owners, threshold, delegates, and routes.
