## Details
# Not compatible with fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
Not compatible with fee-on-transfer tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
In the matchOrder function, when order.asset is a fee-on-transfer token, the amount of tokens received by the contract will be less than takerPrice+makerPrice, which will lead to the following situations:
1. In the settleContract function, sending tokens to bear will fail due to insufficient token balance
2. In the reclaimContract function, sending tokens to bull fails due to insufficient token balance
3. In the withdrawFees function, sending tokens to the owner will fail due to insufficient token balance
## Impact
1. In the settleContract function, sending tokens to bear will fail due to insufficient token balance
2. In the reclaimContract function, sending tokens to bull fails due to insufficient token balance
3. In the withdrawFees function, sending tokens to the owner will fail due to insufficient token balance

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider getting the received amount by calculating the difference of token balance (using balanceOf) before and after the transferFrom.
