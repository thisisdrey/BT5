# Q895: initialize: account migration duplicates or strands value [init-under-boundary-conditions-for] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `initialize_account` with init under boundary conditions for flags and counters that start non-zero so `initialize` duplicates, drops, or strands balances during account migration or transfer, violating `new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context` and causing `High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `initialize`
- Entrypoint: `initialize_account`
- Attacker controls: init under boundary conditions for flags and counters that start non-zero
- Exploit idea: Probe migration edges where balances, fees, or authorities are copied then cleared, especially if one half can be replayed or partially completed. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze
- Fast validation: Simulate partial completion and replay attempts, then assert total exposure across old and new accounts stays conserved. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
