# Q3238: insert via liquidate-multi: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the full batch list and its ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id, so the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
