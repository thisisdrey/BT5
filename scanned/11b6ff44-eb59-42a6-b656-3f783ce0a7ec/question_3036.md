# Q3036: calc-utilization via accrue: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update reach `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `accrue` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `calc-utilization` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
