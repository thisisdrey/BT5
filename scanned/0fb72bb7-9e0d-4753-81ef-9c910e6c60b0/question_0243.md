# Q0243: write-feeds via liquidate: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`write-feeds` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149) folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `min-collateral-expected`, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149` -> `write-feeds`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Reach it through `liquidate` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `write-feeds` touches, run `liquidate` with `min-collateral-expected`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
