# [H] Envoy: HTTP/3 to HTTP/1 request smuggling via headers-only request with nonzero Content-Length

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: BIT-envoy-2026-48743
Aliases: CVE-2026-48743, GHSA-8phg-2h2q-jgxf
Ecosystem: Bitnami
Published: 2026-06-30
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-envoy-2026-48743
Type: osv

## Affected
- Bitnami: `envoy` — affected >=1.38.0 <1.38.1

## Details
Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to 1.35.11, 1.36.7, 1.37.3, and 1.38.1, Envoy can translate a downstream HTTP/3 request that is complete at the transport layer (HEADERS with FIN / headers-only close) but still carries a nonzero Content-Length into a complete upstream HTTP/1 request with unresolved body debt. In an HTTP/1 upstream deployment where the origin replies before reading the declared body and keeps the connection reusable, the beginning of the next Envoy-generated upstream request can be consumed as the first request's body. The remaining bytes are then parsed by the origin as a new HTTP/1 request. This was reproduced as a route-bypass/desync: direct /pwn was denied by Envoy, but the second downstream H3 stream received the response for backend-parsed GET /pwn HTTP/1.1. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.35.11, 1.36.7, 1.37.3, and 1.38.1.
