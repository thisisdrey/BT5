# [H] Omnigent Guardrail policy bypass: shell-command parser fails open in policies/builtins/_shell.py

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-62676
Aliases: GHSA-7mqg-cx4g-x2rf, PYSEC-2026-3873
CVSS: 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

Type: osv

## Details
Omnigent is an open-source AI agent framework and meta-harness for orchestrating coding agents. Prior to 0.3.0, the shared shell-command parser in omnigent/policies/builtins/_shell.py fails to recognize combined interpreter flags, the timeout, nice, setsid, and stdbuf wrappers, command substitutions, and a single background control operator. A gated git push or gh write hidden with these forms produces no parsed operation, causing the github.py write_repos and write_branches allowlist and the working_dir.py workspace confinement policies to abstain and allow the command. An authenticated or prompt-injected agent can therefore push to an unauthorized repository or branch or escape the intended workspace. This issue is fixed in version 0.3.0.
