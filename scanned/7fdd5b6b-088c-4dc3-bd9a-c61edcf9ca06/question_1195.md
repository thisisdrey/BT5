# Q1195: get_writable_account_fee panics on attacker-reachable input (prioritization_fee.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `get_writable_account_fee` in `runtime/src/prioritization_fee.rs` with the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `get_writable_account_fee`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/prioritization_fee.rs` -> `get_writable_account_fee()` (around line 232)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices
- Exploit idea: Reach `get_writable_account_fee` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `get_writable_account_fee` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged remote client can send TPU/QUIC traffic or transaction packets that panic, deadlock, or unboundedly grow memory in ingress, sigverify, scheduling, or PoH, halting block production across the cluster.
