# Q3702: receive-tokens via supply-collateral-add: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, can an unprivileged attacker make `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account, so the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position state the final collateral-add is validated against across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `receive-tokens` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
