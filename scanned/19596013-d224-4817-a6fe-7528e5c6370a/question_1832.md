# Q1832: batch_insert_zero_lamport_single_ref_account_offsets mishandles duplicate/aliased accounts (account_storage_entry.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `batch_insert_zero_lamport_single_ref_account_offsets` in `accounts-db/src/account_storage_entry.rs` with the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices, and have `batch_insert_zero_lamport_single_ref_account_offsets` read a stale copy of an account passed twice in the same instruction, so that the invariant "Aliased account references observe a single coherent value throughout the instruction." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/account_storage_entry.rs` -> `batch_insert_zero_lamport_single_ref_account_offsets()` (around line 172)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices
- Exploit idea: Pass the same account at two indices so `batch_insert_zero_lamport_single_ref_account_offsets` reads a stale copy and writes back a value computed from it, duplicating or erasing a balance.
- Invariant to test: Aliased account references observe a single coherent value throughout the instruction.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Unit test the path with the same pubkey at two indices; assert the final lamports match the single-reference case.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can get a packet accepted into banking with signature verification, dedup, or sanitization effectively skipped, so an unauthorized or malformed transaction reaches execution.
