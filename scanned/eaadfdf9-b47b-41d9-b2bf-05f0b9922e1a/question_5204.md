# Q5204: filter-out-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed varied, and assert that the value `filter-out-debt-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
