# Q1424: get-egroup via borrow: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `borrow` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `get-egroup` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
