# [M] OpenClaw: Gateway Canvas local-direct requests bypass Canvas HTTP and WebSocket authentication

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-6mqc-jqh6-x8fc
CVE: CVE-2026-35634
CWE: CWE-287
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N (CVSS_V4)

Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- npm: `openclaw` — affected >=0 <2026.3.23

## Details
## Summary
Before `v2026.3.23`, Canvas and A2UI loopback requests could bypass Canvas bearer-or-capability authentication because `authorizeCanvasRequest(...)` treated `isLocalDirectRequest(...)` as an unconditional allow path.

## Affected Packages / Versions
- Package: `openclaw` (npm)
- Affected: `< 2026.3.23`
- Fixed: `>= 2026.3.23`
- Latest released tag checked: `v2026.3.23-2` (`630f1479c44f78484dfa21bb407cbe6f171dac87`)
- Latest published npm version checked: `2026.3.23-2`

## Root Cause
The vulnerable logic lived in `src/gateway/server/http-auth.ts`. `authorizeCanvasRequest(...)` returned `{ ok: true }` for local-direct requests before checking bearer authentication or an active node canvas capability, which meant unauthenticated loopback Canvas HTTP and WebSocket requests could succeed.

## Fix Commit(s)
- `d5dc6b6573ae489bc7e5651090f4767b93537c9e` — `fix(gateway): require auth for canvas routes`

## Release Status
The fix commit is contained in released tags `v2026.3.23` and `v2026.3.23-2`. The latest shipped tag and npm release both include the fix.

## Code-Level Confirmation
- `src/gateway/server/http-auth.ts` no longer contains the local-direct early return in `authorizeCanvasRequest(...)`.
- `src/gateway/server.canvas-auth.test.ts` adds the regression test `denies canvas HTTP/WS on loopback without bearer or capability by default`.

Thanks @smaeljaish771 for reporting.
