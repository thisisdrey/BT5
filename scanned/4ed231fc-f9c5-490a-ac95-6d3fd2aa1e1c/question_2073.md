# Q2073: Vault async deposit flow: multi-request / price-lock break / proportional decay

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with multiple pending deposit requests for the same controller before any claim while the manager approves only part of the pending assets before later approvals and make the shares claimed exceed the approval-time price lock for the same controller, breaking the rule that claimableDepositAssets[controller] and claimableDepositShares[controller] should decay proportionally to the actual claim and leading to User funds stuck because approved deposits become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: multiple pending deposit requests for the same controller before any claim
- Exploit idea: make the shares claimed exceed the approval-time price lock for the same controller
- Invariant to test: claimableDepositAssets[controller] and claimableDepositShares[controller] should decay proportionally to the actual claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved deposits become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Simulate partial approvals across time and assert claimable assets and shares can always be fully exhausted without dust-locking value.
