# Q3059: Address-book role bit isolation: zero-like target / bit confusion / precise unregister

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with edge-case grantee addresses such as zero-like or contract addresses the attacker controls while the canonical `address(this)` book and a self-managed book both contain related addresses and make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role, breaking the rule that unregistering one role should not leave or remove unrelated role authority unexpectedly and leading to Loans NFT or cashflow rights entering an unauthorized counterparty context?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: edge-case grantee addresses such as zero-like or contract addresses the attacker controls
- Exploit idea: make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role
- Invariant to test: unregistering one role should not leave or remove unrelated role authority unexpectedly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT or cashflow rights entering an unauthorized counterparty context
- Fast validation: Check that mixed legitimate multi-role grantees do not accidentally satisfy unrelated authorization checks.
