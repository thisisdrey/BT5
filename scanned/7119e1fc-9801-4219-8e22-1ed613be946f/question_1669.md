# Q1669: load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions accepts input it should reject (transaction_processor.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions` in `svm/src/transaction_processor.rs` with a field ordering or duplicate field that the decoder tolerates but the consumer does not, and have `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/transaction_processor.rs` -> `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions()` (around line 402)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a field ordering or duplicate field that the decoder tolerates but the consumer does not
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `load_and_execute_sanitized_transactions` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
