# Q2744: Vault NAV freshness and cross-contract state: loan transfer / stale ledger / no stale claims

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower, investor, buyer, seller, or shareholder interacting through ordinary protocol entrypoints enter through `Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals` with a normal ERC721 transfer of an attacker-owned loan NFT into or out of the vault address while the affected loan is in or near the curated `_navLoanIds` set used for pricing and make a user-controlled entitlement or cashflow change create a price-sensitive stale-state window across approvals, breaking the rule that an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone and leading to Accounting issue in the vault leading to underbacked claims or mispriced shares?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / _requireFreshNav, updateNav, collectCashflows, fundLoans, createSaleOffer, acceptSaleOffer
- Entrypoint: Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals
- Attacker controls: a normal ERC721 transfer of an attacker-owned loan NFT into or out of the vault address
- Exploit idea: make a user-controlled entitlement or cashflow change create a price-sensitive stale-state window across approvals
- Invariant to test: an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in the vault leading to underbacked claims or mispriced shares
- Fast validation: Model borrower payments and external offer settlements right before manager approvals and assert no stale snapshot remains usable.
