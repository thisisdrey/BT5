# Q0802: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: charged-off pay / clearing mismatch / entitlement isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with payments into a loan that is `ChargedOff` but still accepts borrower payments while an investor or vault cashflow collection could run soon after the borrower payment and make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes, breaking the rule that a borrower should not be able to distort another user's principal or interest entitlements just by timing ordinary payments and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution between current and future investors or shareholders?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: payments into a loan that is `ChargedOff` but still accepts borrower payments
- Exploit idea: make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes
- Invariant to test: a borrower should not be able to distort another user's principal or interest entitlements just by timing ordinary payments
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution between current and future investors or shareholders
- Fast validation: Check that repeated ordinary payments cannot create a durable wedge between on-chain cash and user-withdrawable or priceable balances.
