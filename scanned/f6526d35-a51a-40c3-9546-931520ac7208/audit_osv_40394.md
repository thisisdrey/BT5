# [H] bpf: Fix stale offload->prog pointer after constant blinding

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-53094
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2026-06-24
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-53094
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=6.3.0 <6.6.141, >=6.7.0 <6.12.91, >=6.13.0 <6.18.33, >=6.19.0 <7.0.10

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix stale offload->prog pointer after constant blinding

When a dev-bound-only BPF program (BPF_F_XDP_DEV_BOUND_ONLY) undergoes
JIT compilation with constant blinding enabled (bpf_jit_harden >= 2),
bpf_jit_blind_constants() clones the program. The original prog is then
freed in bpf_jit_prog_release_other(), which updates aux->prog to point
to the surviving clone, but fails to update offload->prog.

This leaves offload->prog pointing to the freed original program. When
the network namespace is subsequently destroyed, cleanup_net() triggers
bpf_dev_bound_netdev_unregister(), which iterates ondev->progs and calls
__bpf_prog_offload_destroy(offload->prog). Accessing the freed prog
causes a page fault:

BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc900085f1038
Workqueue: netns cleanup_net
RIP: 0010:__bpf_prog_offload_destroy+0xc/0x80
Call Trace:
__bpf_offload_dev_netdev_unregister+0x257/0x350
bpf_dev_bound_netdev_unregister+0x4a/0x90
unregister_netdevice_many_notify+0x2a2/0x660
...
cleanup_net+0x21a/0x320

The test sequence that triggers this reliably is:

1. Set net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2 (echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_harden)
2. Run xdp_metadata selftest, which creates a dev-bound-only XDP
   program on a veth inside a netns (./test_progs -t xdp_metadata)
3. cleanup_net -> page fault in __bpf_prog_offload_destroy

Dev-bound-only programs are unique in that they have an offload structure
but go through the normal JIT path instead of bpf_prog_offload_compile().
This means they are subject to constant blinding's prog clone-and-replace,
while also having offload->prog that must stay in sync.

Fix this by updating offload->prog in bpf_jit_prog_release_other(),
alongside the existing aux->prog update. Both are back-pointers to
the prog that must be kept in sync when the prog is replaced.
