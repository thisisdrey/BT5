# Q0128: nominate can break Ledger / Nominators conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `nominate` with crafted duplicate or adversarial list ordering so `Ledger` and `Nominators` diverge for the same economic action, enabling theft, unbacked minting, or hidden debt?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/staking/src/pallet/mod.rs::nominate
- Entrypoint: signed extrinsic `nominate`
- Attacker controls: duplicate or adversarial list ordering
- Exploit idea: Stress exact-threshold accounting so one side of the debit/credit path commits while the paired update lags or rounds away.
- Invariant to test: `Ledger`, `Nominators`, and user-visible balances must conserve value across success, failure, and repetition.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft of user funds / unbacked mint or pool insolvency
- Fast validation: Boundary-test zero, minimum, maximum, and just-above-threshold values and assert end-state conservation.
