# Q3161: Address-book role bit isolation: canonical adjacency / whitelist bypass / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with self-book actions performed near canonical-book admin changes but without any privileged access while a later `createOffer` or `acceptOffer` flow will read the investor bit from both sides' books and make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present, breaking the rule that each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role and leading to Loans NFT or cashflow rights entering an unauthorized counterparty context?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: self-book actions performed near canonical-book admin changes but without any privileged access
- Exploit idea: make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present
- Invariant to test: each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT or cashflow rights entering an unauthorized counterparty context
- Fast validation: Check that mixed legitimate multi-role grantees do not accidentally satisfy unrelated authorization checks.
