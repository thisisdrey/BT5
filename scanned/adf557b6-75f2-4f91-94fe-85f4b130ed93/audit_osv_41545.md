# [M] Wazuh discloses cleartext cluster key to low-privilege API users via GET /cluster/local/config

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-61802
Aliases: GHSA-chmg-89pf-2q82
CVSS: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Type: osv

## Details
Wazuh is an open-source security platform providing unified XDR and SIEM protection for endpoints and cloud workloads. In versions 4.14.0 through 4.14.6, a low-privilege API user can read the cleartext cluster key from a configuration endpoint that fails to redact it. The REST API provides a masking control, mask_sensitive_config, that redacts sensitive fields such as authd.pass and cluster.key from configuration responses for users who lack update-config permission, and every config-read endpoint carries this decorator except GET /cluster/local/config. That endpoint, backed by read_config_wrapper, is gated only by cluster:read and returns the local node's cluster configuration including the cleartext key, whereas its siblings return the same value masked. As a result, any account with the default readonly or cluster_readonly role, which is explicitly denied update-config precisely so it cannot view secrets, receives the real cluster key. Because the cluster key authenticates and encrypts traffic between cluster nodes, disclosing it to an unprivileged account provides the authentication precondition for the cluster-peer remote code execution chains established by prior advisories. This issue is fixed in version 4.14.
