# Q4628: accrue-user-collateral via deposit: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-out` reach `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `deposit` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with `min-out` varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
