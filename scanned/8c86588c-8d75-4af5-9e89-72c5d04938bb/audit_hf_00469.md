## Details
An order's direction is determined by whether the current exchangeRate is below or above the takeProfit price
```solidity
orders[existingOrderId] = Order({
    orderId: existingOrderId,
    takeProfit: takeProfit,
    stopPrice: stopPrice,
    amountIn: amountIn,
    tokenIn: tokenIn,
    tokenOut: tokenOut,
    recipient: recipient,
    takeProfitSlippage: takeProfitSlippage,
    feeBips: feeBips,
    stopSlippage: stopSlippage,
    direction: MASTER.getExchangeRate(tokenIn, tokenOut) > takeProfit //exchangeRate in/out > takeProfit
});
```

However, this could be problematic, in the case where by the time the user's transaction is executed, the price moves beyond the takeProfit price and changes direction.
```solidity
function checkInRange(
    Order memory order
) internal view returns (bool inRange, bool takeProfit, uint256 exchangeRate)
{
    exchangeRate = MASTER.getExchangeRate(order.tokenIn, order.tokenOut);
    if (order.direction) {
        //check for take profit price
        if (exchangeRate <= order.takeProfit) {
            return (true, true, exchangeRate);
        }
        //check for stop price
        if (exchangeRate >= order.stopPrice) {
            return (true, false, exchangeRate);
        }
    } else {
        //check for take profit price
        if (exchangeRate >= order.takeProfit) {
            return (true, true, exchangeRate);
        }
        //check for stop price
        if (exchangeRate <= order.stopPrice) {
            return (true, false, exchangeRate);
        }
    }
}
```

In this case both of the takeProfit and stopPrice would be on the same side of the price, which would also make it instantly executable. The only problem is that it would be treated as a stop, rather than a takeProfit, which would result in using the stopSlippage, instead of the takeProfitSlippage.  
In the case where the stopSlippage is higher than the takeProfit slippage, this would expose the user to a higher loss of funds than expected.

Wrong direction logic.

Attack Path  
1. Current WETH/ USDC price is $3000  
2. User creates an offer with tp $3100 and stopPrice $2800. takeProfitSlippage is 5% and stopPriceSlippage is 15%  
3. By the time the user's tx is executed, WETH's price goes above $3100. This changes the order's direction.  
4. Both of the tp price and stop price are below the current price.  
5. The order will be executed as a stop price, using the 15% slippage. This exposes the user to extra 10% loss.

Using wrong slippage parameter.

## Recommendation
Allow the user to specify the direction.
