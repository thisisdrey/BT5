# Q5037: get-account-scaled-debt via borrow: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, drive `get-account-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307) — which reads one scaled debt row — to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, breaking the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307` -> `get-account-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row. Reach it through `borrow` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-account-scaled-debt` touches, run `borrow` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
