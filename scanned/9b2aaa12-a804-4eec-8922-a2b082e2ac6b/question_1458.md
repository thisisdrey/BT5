# Q1458: Loan NFT lock and nonce state: buyer settlement / nonce miss / epoch cleanliness

## Question
Can an unprivileged current owner, approved address, buyer, or seller using ordinary NFT actions enter through `LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom` with an exchange-driven transfer by the active unlocker into a buyer-controlled address while another contract or process will read ownerAndUnlocker or ownershipNonce immediately after the action and make an ownership-set change fail to produce the nonce signal a downstream contract expects, breaking the rule that lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward and leading to Unintended or unfair reassignment of loan cashflow rights?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansNFT.sol / lock, unlock, _update
- Entrypoint: LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom
- Attacker controls: an exchange-driven transfer by the active unlocker into a buyer-controlled address
- Exploit idea: make an ownership-set change fail to produce the nonce signal a downstream contract expects
- Invariant to test: lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair reassignment of loan cashflow rights
- Fast validation: Forge test per-token approvals, lock/unlock cycles, and transfers, then assert nonce, owner, and unlocker views stay in one epoch.
