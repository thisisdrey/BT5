# Q0336: Loans funding and disbursement state: standing allowance / epoch confusion / same-loan accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing while the loan is still `Created` with positive borrower principal receivable and zero investor principal payable and make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions, breaking the rule that funding or disbursing one loan should never create withdrawable or priceable balances attributable to another loan or investor and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution between investor, borrower, and originator paths?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing
- Exploit idea: make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions
- Invariant to test: funding or disbursing one loan should never create withdrawable or priceable balances attributable to another loan or investor
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution between investor, borrower, and originator paths
- Fast validation: Fuzz commitment-sized amounts and lifecycle orderings, then assert funding and disbursement preserve the exact same commitment ledger.
