## Details
# Future fee on transfer ERC20 fees cannot be withdrawn

## Summary

Protocol cannot use fee on transfer ERC20-s, because the fee is not accounted for and `withdrawableFees` amount will be invalid.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `matchOrder`, you assume that the full amount is transferred from `msg.sender`. However, for fee on transfer tokens, some amount will not be sent to the receiver.

```solidity
bullFees = (order.collateral * fee) / 1000;
bearFees = (order.premium * fee) / 1000;

withdrawableFees[order.asset] += bullFees + bearFees;
```

This means the withdrawable fee is invalid, because token transfer fee is not accounted for.

## Impact

Protocol cannot withdraw future fee on transfer asset fees, because it expects too many tokens to exist in the contract. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
if (fee > 0) {
    bullFees = (order.collateral * fee) / 1000;
    bearFees = (order.premium * fee) / 1000;

    withdrawableFees[order.asset] += bullFees + bearFees;
}

makerPrice = order.collateral + bullFees;
takerPrice = order.premium + bearFees;
...
IERC20(order.asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), takerPrice);
IERC20(order.asset).safeTransferFrom(order.maker, address(this), makerPrice);
```

```solidity
function withdrawFees(address asset, address recipient) external onlyOwner {
    uint amount = withdrawableFees[asset];

    withdrawableFees[asset] = 0;

    IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(recipient, amount);

    emit WithdrawnFees(asset, amount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check how much tokens were actually sent by subtracting after transfer balance from pre-transfer balance on the BvB.
