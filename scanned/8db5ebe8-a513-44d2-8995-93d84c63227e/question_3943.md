# Q3943: Smart account deployment and initialization: duplicate entries / address confusion / initializer fidelity

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays while other users or systems rely on the predicted address before the account is actually deployed and make predicted-address semantics diverge from the actual deployed account or from who effectively controls it, breaking the rule that duplicate or crafted array inputs should not silently widen module delegates or spending surface beyond the explicit initializer semantics and leading to Theft or redirection of value sent to a predicted or freshly deployed smart account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays
- Exploit idea: make predicted-address semantics diverge from the actual deployed account or from who effectively controls it
- Invariant to test: duplicate or crafted array inputs should not silently widen module delegates or spending surface beyond the explicit initializer semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or redirection of value sent to a predicted or freshly deployed smart account
- Fast validation: Model predicted-address observation and deployment races and ensure a third party cannot change who effectively controls the resulting account.
