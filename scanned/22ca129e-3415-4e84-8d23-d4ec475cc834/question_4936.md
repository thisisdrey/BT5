# Q4936: linear-interpolate via deposit: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `deposit` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
