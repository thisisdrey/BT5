# Q2573: add_sub - overflow branch reported as success (15)

## Question
Given one leg's magnitude sits at or next to `i128::MIN` / `u128::MAX`, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` `msg` with `execute_intents` funded by the attacker's own deposit, drive `checked_sub` in `crates/num-utils/src/add_sub.rs` into the arm where an arithmetic overflow yields `unwrap_or_default()` (zero) and is therefore indistinguishable from a balanced result, breaking the invariant `an arithmetic overflow during finalisation always aborts the batch, never reports balance` and leading to protocol insolvency: sum of `token_balances` owed exceeds assets actually custodied by the Verifier?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/num-utils/src/add_sub.rs](crates/num-utils/src/add_sub.rs) - `checked_sub` (cross-check `CheckedAdd` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` `msg` with `execute_intents` funded by the attacker's own deposit
- Attacker controls: the deposited amount, the nested batch, and `refund_if_fails`
- Exploit idea: The `finalize_into` error path folds remaining amounts with `checked_add` then `i128::try_from` then `checked_neg`, defaulting to 0 on failure; a returned 0 is treated as 'no unmatched delta'. Set-up: one leg's magnitude sits at or next to `i128::MIN` / `u128::MAX`.
- Invariant to test: an arithmetic overflow during finalisation always aborts the batch, never reports balance
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency: sum of `token_balances` owed exceeds assets actually custodied by the Verifier
- Fast validation: Construct deltas whose remaining totals exceed `i128::MAX`; assert `finalize()` returns `InvariantViolated::Overflow`.
