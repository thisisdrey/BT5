# Q0483: allow_mtu_overflow is not deterministic across nodes (tx_loop.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `allow_mtu_overflow` in `xdp/src/tx_loop.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make the packets marked signature-verified disagree with the packets whose signatures were actually checked, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `allow_mtu_overflow` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `xdp/src/tx_loop.rs` -> `allow_mtu_overflow()` (around line 219)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Find input to `allow_mtu_overflow` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `allow_mtu_overflow` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `allow_mtu_overflow` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
