# Q3690: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: shared delegate / route widening / strict expiry

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with the same delegate address authorized on one Safe but not another Safe with similar recipients while there are several recipient routes for the same Safe and token or collection and spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe, breaking the rule that expired allowances should never authorize any further ERC20 or ERC721 movement and leading to Protocol-facing unauthorized transfers that later harm another user or vault?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: the same delegate address authorized on one Safe but not another Safe with similar recipients
- Exploit idea: spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe
- Invariant to test: expired allowances should never authorize any further ERC20 or ERC721 movement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol-facing unauthorized transfers that later harm another user or vault
- Fast validation: Fuzz allowance expiry at the block boundary and ensure no post-expiry transfer succeeds for ERC20 or ERC721 routes.
