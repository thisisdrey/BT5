# Q1289: resolve-dia via collateral-remove-redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, drive `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) — which derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
