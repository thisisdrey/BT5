## Summary
Severity: Medium (CVSS 6.2)
Program: Kubernetes
Weakness: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
Reporter: derek0405
State: resolved
Disclosed: 2020-11-29T21:23:27.388Z

Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/966383

## Details
Report Submission Form

## Summary:
When create k8s cluster over vsphere and enable vsphere as cloud provider. With logging level set to 4 or above, secret information will be printed out in the cloud controller manager's log.

## Kubernetes Version:
1.18.6

## Component Version:
legacy cloud provider

## Steps To Reproduce:
[add details for how we can reproduce the issue, including relevant cluster setup and configuration]

  1. Configure vsphere as cloud provider and set logging level to 4 or above (https://cloud-provider-vsphere.sigs.k8s.io/tutorials/kubernetes-on-vsphere-with-kubeadm.html)
  2. Check vsphere cloud provider log when a secret is created or udpated as the secret informer is registered with and will be print out when the logging level set to 4 or above.

## Impact

If any kubernetes users or service accounts has privileges (e.g. GET pods/log  in the kube-system namespace), he will be able to view all the secrets data when a secret is created or updated which may contain sensitive data such as password or private key. Further, is the secret is a service account token, then the user may escalate his privileges.
