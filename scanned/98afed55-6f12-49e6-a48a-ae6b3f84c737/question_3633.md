# Q3633: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: expiry edge / safe confusion / per-safe route binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries while another Safe has a similar delegate or recipient topology but no matching route and make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context, breaking the rule that delegate rights and allowances should bind to one exact `(safe, token-or-collection, recipient)` route only and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context
- Invariant to test: delegate rights and allowances should bind to one exact `(safe, token-or-collection, recipient)` route only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient
- Fast validation: Model repeated finite-allowance transfers and assert the stored allowance matches the exact total transferred.
