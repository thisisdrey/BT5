# Q3958: Smart account deployment and initialization: duplicate entries / address confusion / predictability

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays while the resulting Safe will immediately be used against TrustedCalls or TrustedSpender surfaces and make predicted-address semantics diverge from the actual deployed account or from who effectively controls it, breaking the rule that the predicted address for a given deployer, nonce, and initializer should match exactly one controllable deployment outcome and leading to Theft or redirection of value sent to a predicted or freshly deployed smart account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays
- Exploit idea: make predicted-address semantics diverge from the actual deployed account or from who effectively controls it
- Invariant to test: the predicted address for a given deployer, nonce, and initializer should match exactly one controllable deployment outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or redirection of value sent to a predicted or freshly deployed smart account
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated delegatecall attempts into `configureSmartAccount` and assert the one-shot guard holds in every reachable context.
