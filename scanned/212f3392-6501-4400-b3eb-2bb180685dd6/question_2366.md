# Q2366: resolve via collateral-add: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask, so the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360` -> `resolve`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Reach it through `collateral-add` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the position's existing collateral and debt composition varied, and assert that the value `resolve` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
