# Q3520: accrue via redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `recipient` reach `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with `recipient`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
