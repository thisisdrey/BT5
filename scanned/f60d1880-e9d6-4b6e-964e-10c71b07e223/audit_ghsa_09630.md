# [H] zrok: WebDAV drive backend follows symlinks outside DriveRoot, enabling host filesystem read/write

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-74m3-9qvm-rp9h
CVE: CVE-2026-42275
CWE: CWE-22, CWE-61
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-04-25
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-74m3-9qvm-rp9h
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/openziti/zrok` — affected >=0
- Go: `github.com/openziti/zrok/v2` — affected >=0 <2.0.2

## Details
**Summary**
The zrok WebDAV drive backend (davServer.Dir) restricts path traversal through lexical normalization but does not prevent symlink following. When a symbolic link inside the shared DriveRoot points to a location outside that root, remote WebDAV consumers can read files and—on shares without OS-level permission restrictions—write or overwrite files anywhere on the host filesystem accessible to the zrok process.

- Attack Vector: Network — exploitation is performed entirely over the WebDAV endpoint; the attacker issues HTTP requests to the public zrok share URL.
- Attack Complexity: High — a precondition outside the attacker's direct control must hold: a symlink pointing outside DriveRoot must already exist within it (created locally, not via WebDAV).
- Privileges Required: None — zrok share public --backend-mode drive exposes the WebDAV endpoint with no authentication by default.
- User Interaction: None — once the symlink precondition is met, exploitation requires no user interaction.
- Scope: Changed — the vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the WebDAV root (the security boundary) and access the broader host filesystem.
- Confidentiality Impact: High — arbitrary files readable by the zrok process can be retrieved.
- Integrity Impact: High — the WebDAV PUT handler opens files with O_RDWR|O_CREATE|O_TRUNC, meaning symlink targets outside DriveRoot can be overwritten (e.g. ~/.ssh/authorized_keys).
- Availability Impact: None — no direct availability impact.
