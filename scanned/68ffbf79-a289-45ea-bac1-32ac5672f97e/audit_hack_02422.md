# [M] Formula and documentation mismatch

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Source: https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-contracts/blob/3f345ce52bc378c4b5d710c80d817db170775049/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Mailbox.sol#L509
Type: audit-issue

## Details
The [formula for overheadForPublicData](https://www.notion.so/matterlabs/zkSync-fee-model-8e6c9196f4f84105a958a0e2463c3b39?pvs=4#0fc2b9fcb5f24acc90f926f78df90bd3) uses `Tm` which is defined [as the maximal transaction ergs limit here](https://www.notion.so/matterlabs/zkSync-fee-model-8e6c9196f4f84105a958a0e2463c3b39?pvs=4#1e9678ff8c0e46f291130cb52c3f7867).

This appears to correspond in code to `L2_TX_MAX_GAS_LIMIT`:

> /// @dev The maximum number of L2 gas that a user can request for an L2 transaction

However, the calculation in code [uses the MAX\_PUBDATA\_PER\_BLOCK](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-contracts/blob/3f345ce52bc378c4b5d710c80d817db170775049/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Mailbox.sol#L509) constant instead, which refers to:

> _/// @dev The maximum number of the pubdata an L2 operation should be allowed to use._

This corresponds [to Pm](https://www.notion.so/matterlabs/zkSync-fee-model-8e6c9196f4f84105a958a0e2463c3b39?pvs=4#0389150f6da2408ebdeda7c8b5c53598) in the documentation.

These appear to be different quantities, measured in different units, of different magnitudes (`80000000` vs `110000`). As a result, a denial of service may occur if the overhead is calculated incorrectly (underestimated), which will result in `l2GasForTxBody` being overestimated, and possibly [reverting in \_writePriorityOp](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-contracts/blob/3f345ce52bc378c4b5d710c80d817db170775049/ethereum/contracts/zksync/facets/Mailbox.sol#L346-L348) despite having legitimate values passed as inputs.

Alternatively, as the overhead is underestimated, a larger-than-limit `l2GasForTxBody` may be submitted, which will cause failures on L2.

Consider adding test cases to the documentation with concrete example values, and implementing these test cases in the codebase test suite to ensure basic compatibility. Additionally, consider documenting in code both the correspondence of the constants to the documentation’s notation, and the derivation and logic of the formulas implemented in comments in the same file, so that access to external documentation would not prevent the reader from reviewing the code.

_**Update:** Partially resolved in [pull request #34](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-contracts/pull/34) at commit [19c7b81](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-contracts/pull/34/commits/19c7b81fb521ebbf639d68b6fd4eafbcc0503989). The Matter Labs team stated:_

> _Acknowledged. For now, we have decided to temporarily remove the overhead. The issue will be fixed once we introduce the block overhead back to our users._
