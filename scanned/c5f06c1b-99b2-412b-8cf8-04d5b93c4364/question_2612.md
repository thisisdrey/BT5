# Q2612: accrue-user-collateral via call-ststx-ratio: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block reach `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
