# Q1442: Loan NFT lock and nonce state: buyer settlement / nonce miss / epoch cleanliness

## Question
Can an unprivileged current owner, approved address, buyer, or seller using ordinary NFT actions enter through `LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom` with an exchange-driven transfer by the active unlocker into a buyer-controlled address while the token was just unlocked after a prior listing or transfer cycle and make an ownership-set change fail to produce the nonce signal a downstream contract expects, breaking the rule that lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward and leading to Bypass or corruption of downstream ownership-change checks that gate vault pricing or withdrawals?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansNFT.sol / lock, unlock, _update
- Entrypoint: LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom
- Attacker controls: an exchange-driven transfer by the active unlocker into a buyer-controlled address
- Exploit idea: make an ownership-set change fail to produce the nonce signal a downstream contract expects
- Invariant to test: lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass or corruption of downstream ownership-change checks that gate vault pricing or withdrawals
- Fast validation: Check that no normal lock or transfer sequence leaves a token or its associated withdrawal rights permanently stranded.
