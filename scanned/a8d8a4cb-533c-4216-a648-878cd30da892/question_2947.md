# Q2947: interest-rate via liquidate-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
`interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the redemption receiver, use that to make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree, violating the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, then read `interest-rate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
