# Q3561: close_account: account-state transition skips a mandatory precondition [a-migrated-account-context] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `close_account` with a migrated account context so `close_account` performs a state transition without validating a required precondition, breaking `closing an account must never strand value or release a container that still secures live positions` and causing `High: permanent lock or hidden exposure with real financial effect`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/marginfi_account/close.rs` / `close_account`
- Entrypoint: `close_account`
- Attacker controls: a migrated account context
- Exploit idea: Focus on initialize/close/freeze/sync transitions where one branch may skip a check that sibling branches enforce. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: closing an account must never strand value or release a container that still secures live positions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent lock or hidden exposure with real financial effect
- Fast validation: Hit the suspect branch directly in a test and assert it rejects the same invalid pre-state that other equivalent branches reject. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
