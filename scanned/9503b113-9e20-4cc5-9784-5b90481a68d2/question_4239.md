# Q4239: DeleteAccount beneficiary loop — deterministic_account_id.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through `CreateAccount` + `DeleteAccount` action sequences on attacker-owned sub-accounts, two attacker accounts each naming the other as DeleteAccount beneficiary in the same block, when combined with a DeleteAccount later in the same action list, and additionally when the receiver account already exists with balance and keys, reach `code` in `core/primitives-core/src/deterministic_account_id.rs` and make the transfer of remaining balance loop, drop, or double-credit, breaking the invariant that the deleted account's balance lands exactly once with the beneficiary or is refunded, leading to Critical - Direct loss of funds (protocol-level balance created, destroyed, or moved outside protocol rules)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives-core/src/deterministic_account_id.rs` :: `code`
- Entrypoint: `CreateAccount` + `DeleteAccount` action sequences on attacker-owned sub-accounts
- Attacker controls: two attacker accounts each naming the other as DeleteAccount beneficiary in the same block; when combined with a DeleteAccount later in the same action list; when the receiver account already exists with balance and keys
- Exploit idea: make the transfer of remaining balance loop, drop, or double-credit
- Invariant to test: the deleted account's balance lands exactly once with the beneficiary or is refunded
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct loss of funds (protocol-level balance created, destroyed, or moved outside protocol rules)
- Fast validation: runtime test applying reciprocal DeleteAccount actions in one chunk
