# Q1454: Loan NFT lock and nonce state: buyer settlement / transition gap / epoch cleanliness

## Question
Can an unprivileged current owner, approved address, buyer, or seller using ordinary NFT actions enter through `LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom` with an exchange-driven transfer by the active unlocker into a buyer-controlled address while the token was just unlocked after a prior listing or transfer cycle and make a normal lock/unlock/transfer transition create a gap where no actor can safely use the token or its cashflow rights, breaking the rule that lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward and leading to Loans NFT being stuck or its cashflow rights becoming unavailable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansNFT.sol / lock, unlock, _update
- Entrypoint: LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom
- Attacker controls: an exchange-driven transfer by the active unlocker into a buyer-controlled address
- Exploit idea: make a normal lock/unlock/transfer transition create a gap where no actor can safely use the token or its cashflow rights
- Invariant to test: lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being stuck or its cashflow rights becoming unavailable
- Fast validation: Forge test per-token approvals, lock/unlock cycles, and transfers, then assert nonce, owner, and unlocker views stay in one epoch.
