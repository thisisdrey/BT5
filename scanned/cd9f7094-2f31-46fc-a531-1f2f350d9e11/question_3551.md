# Q3551: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: erc20 route / allowance replay / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with token, from, to, and amount across one allowed route and one nearby disallowed route while the route is configured with an infinite ERC20 allowance and long validity and consume more than a finite allowance by exploiting repeated-call or cross-route accounting boundaries, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: token, from, to, and amount across one allowed route and one nearby disallowed route
- Exploit idea: consume more than a finite allowance by exploiting repeated-call or cross-route accounting boundaries
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts
- Fast validation: Forge test one delegate across several Safes and routes and assert each transfer consumes only the exact approved route.
