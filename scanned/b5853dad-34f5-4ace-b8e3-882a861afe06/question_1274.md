# Q1274: Investor withdrawal routing: epoch split / batch bleed / single claim per payable

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with one loan from a fresh ownership epoch and one loan from a prior epoch that shares the same apparent investor or unlocker while a vault, exchange, or later counterparty relies on the same payable balances after the batch and make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it, breaking the rule that each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: one loan from a fresh ownership epoch and one loan from a prior epoch that shares the same apparent investor or unlocker
- Exploit idea: make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it
- Invariant to test: each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers
- Fast validation: Forge test mixed locked/unlocked batches, duplicate ids, and ownership transfers, then assert each loan pays exactly one valid recipient once.
