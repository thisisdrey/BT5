# Q2066: Vault async deposit flow: multi-request / ratio drift / pending sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with multiple pending deposit requests for the same controller before any claim while the manager approves only part of the pending assets before later approvals and make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess vault-share minting?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: multiple pending deposit requests for the same controller before any claim
- Exploit idea: make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess vault-share minting
- Fast validation: Assert that direct operator churn around request and claim never changes who can consume a controller's approved value.
