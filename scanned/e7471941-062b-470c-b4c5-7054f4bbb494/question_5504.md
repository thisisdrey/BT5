# Q5504: recursive structure depth on deserialisation — serialize.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through `broadcast_tx_commit` / `send_tx` RPC carrying a SignedTransaction signed by an ordinary FullAccess key, deeply nested actions or promise structures at the maximum accepted depth, with a duplicate or out-of-range enum discriminant, and additionally with nesting at exactly the maximum accepted depth, reach `visit_u64` in `core/primitives-core/src/serialize.rs` and reach a recursive decode path that exhausts the native stack before any limit applies, breaking the invariant that decoding depth is bounded before recursion, leading to Critical - Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives-core/src/serialize.rs` :: `visit_u64`
- Entrypoint: `broadcast_tx_commit` / `send_tx` RPC carrying a SignedTransaction signed by an ordinary FullAccess key
- Attacker controls: deeply nested actions or promise structures at the maximum accepted depth; with a duplicate or out-of-range enum discriminant; with nesting at exactly the maximum accepted depth
- Exploit idea: reach a recursive decode path that exhausts the native stack before any limit applies
- Invariant to test: decoding depth is bounded before recursion
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)
- Fast validation: fuzz test over nesting depth up to and past the limit
