## Details
```solidity
Funds withdrawal is blocked as fees are not deducted from fundsPaid when already being applied.
When votes are bought in ReputationMarket market, user has to pay fees:
• donation fees going to owner of the market
• protocol fees going to treasury
This is seen in applyFees function below:
function applyFees(
    uint256 protocolFee,
    uint256 donation,
    uint256 marketOwnerProfileId
) private returns (uint256 fees) {
    donationEscrow[donationRecipient[marketOwnerProfileId]] += donation; // donation fees are updated for market owner
    if (protocolFee > 0) {
        (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: protocolFee }(""); // protocolFees paid to treasury
        if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
    }
    fees = protocolFee + donation;
}
```
Next, the total amount a user pays when votes are bought is managed by the fundsPaid variable. The amount consists of: cost of votes + protocol fees + donation fees.  
The vulnerability exists in the execution here:
1. send protocol fees to the treasury
2. add donations to market owner's escrow
3. marketOwner is able to withdraw donations via withdrawDonations()

In the buyVotes function, protocolFee and donation are paid first as seen below:  
```solidity
applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);
```

Then, when tallying the market funds, marketFunds is updated with fundsPaid. This fundsPaid still includes the protocolFee and donation and has not been deducted.  
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```

Hence, the protocolFee and donation has been counted twice.  
When a market graduates, because of the incorrect counting of marketFunds, the contract may not have enough funds to be withdrawn via ReputationMarket.withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds and results in transaction reverting.

## Proof of Concept
Assume this scenario:  
A market exists with 2 trust votes and 2 distrust votes, each costing 0.03 ETH. Protocol and donation fees are both set at 5%. Alice buys 2 trust votes for 0.07 ETH:  
Fees (5% each): Protocol: 0.0015 ETH per vote → 0.003 ETH total. Donations: 0.0015 ETH per vote → 0.003 ETH total. Vote Cost: 0.03 ETH × 2 = 0.06 ETH. Refund: 0.07 ETH - (0.06 ETH + 0.006 ETH fees) = 0.004 ETH. The contract incorrectly records 0.066 ETH (votes + fees) as market funds.  
Market owner withdraws the 0.06 ETH correctly available.  
After market graduation, the contract attempts to withdraw the recorded 0.066 ETH, but only 0.06 ETH exists.

Impact:  
The withdrawal fails due to insufficient funds. Funds are stuck, or other markets' funds are misallocated. If a withdrawal succeeds, it might wrongly pull ETH allocated to other markets, leading to losses for other users.

Recommendations  
Update logic to deduct protocol fees and donations before updating marketFunds.
