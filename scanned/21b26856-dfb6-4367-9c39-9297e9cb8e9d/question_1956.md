# Q1956: lib - nonce is a u32 with a bounded window (7)

## Question
Given the wallet's nonce bitmap has just rotated `current` into `old`, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `w_execute_extension(request: Request)` called from any predecessor with a non-zero deposit, exploit the 32-bit nonce space and time window enforced around `public_key` in `crates/mpc/ckd/src/lib.rs` to force a collision or exhaustion that either blocks a victim's requests or admits a replay, breaking the invariant `no two distinct signed requests share a nonce within one retention window` and leading to direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/mpc/ckd/src/lib.rs](crates/mpc/ckd/src/lib.rs) - `public_key` (cross-check `is_valid_g1` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `w_execute_extension(request: Request)` called from any predecessor with a non-zero deposit
- Attacker controls: the `Request` contents, the calling account id, and the attached deposit
- Exploit idea: The nonce is `u32` split 27/5 into the bitmap; probe wraparound and the interaction with the dual-window retention. Set-up: the wallet's nonce bitmap has just rotated `current` into `old`.
- Invariant to test: no two distinct signed requests share a nonce within one retention window
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once
- Fast validation: Drive nonces across the `u32` boundary; assert collision handling.
