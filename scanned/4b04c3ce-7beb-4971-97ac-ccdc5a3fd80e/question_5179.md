# Q5179: get-notional-evaluation via collateral-remove-redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), then read `get-notional-evaluation` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
