# Q0619: calc-liq-collateral-repay via liquidate-multi: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`calc-liq-collateral-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728) scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728` -> `calc-liq-collateral-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-collateral-repay` scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, then read `calc-liq-collateral-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
