# [M] Using OpenZeppelin dependency with `ECDSA.recover` vulnerability

## Summary
Severity: Medium

Type: audit-issue

## Details
# Using OpenZeppelin dependency with `ECDSA.recover` vulnerability

## Summary
The project uses 'ECDSA.recover' version 4.7.0 of OZ in the `isValidSignature` function, this is a security vulnerability.


## Vulnerability Detail

The project uses 'ECDSA.recover' ,


```solidity
src/BvbProtocol.sol:
  698       */
  699:     function isValidSignature(address signer, bytes32 orderHash, bytes calldata signature) public pure returns (bool) {
  700:         return ECDSA.recover(orderHash, signature) == signer;
  701:     }

```
The functions ECDSA.recover is vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a single bytes argument, and not the functions that take r, v, s or r, vs as separate arguments.

The potentially affected contracts are those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this protection.

## Impact
@openzeppelin/contracts is a library for contract development.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature via `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format.
