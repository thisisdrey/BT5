# Q0547: write-feed via liquidate: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `borrower`, any third-party principal, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `liquidate` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, then read `write-feed` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
