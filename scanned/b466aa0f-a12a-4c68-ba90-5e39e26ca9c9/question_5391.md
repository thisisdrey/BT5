# Q5391: debt-remove-scaled via liquidate: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `debt-amount`, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `liquidate` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `debt-remove-scaled` touches, run `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
