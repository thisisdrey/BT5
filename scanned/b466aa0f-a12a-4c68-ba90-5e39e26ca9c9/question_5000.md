# Q5000: mask-pos via collateral-add: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `mask-pos` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91` -> `mask-pos`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `mask-pos` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
