# Q0938: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: multi-epoch pay / date inconsistency / entitlement isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with multiple borrower payments straddling a due-date or withdrawal boundary while an investor or vault cashflow collection could run soon after the borrower payment and make repeated `pay` calls leave `lastPaymentDate` and economic balances in an order that later logic misinterprets, breaking the rule that a borrower should not be able to distort another user's principal or interest entitlements just by timing ordinary payments and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution between current and future investors or shareholders?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: multiple borrower payments straddling a due-date or withdrawal boundary
- Exploit idea: make repeated `pay` calls leave `lastPaymentDate` and economic balances in an order that later logic misinterprets
- Invariant to test: a borrower should not be able to distort another user's principal or interest entitlements just by timing ordinary payments
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution between current and future investors or shareholders
- Fast validation: Check that repeated ordinary payments cannot create a durable wedge between on-chain cash and user-withdrawable or priceable balances.
