# Q3428: cleanup - map cleanup removes an entry another view still references (6)

## Question
Given the same key appears twice in the encoded map, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` with a hand-crafted `msg` string, drive `DefaultEntry` in `crates/map-utils/src/cleanup.rs` so the default-map cleanup deletes an entry while an iterator or a cached view still holds it, producing divergent reads within one call, breaking the invariant `every read of a (key, value) within one call returns the same value` and leading to protocol insolvency: sum of `token_balances` owed exceeds assets actually custodied by the Verifier?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/map-utils/src/cleanup.rs](crates/map-utils/src/cleanup.rs) - `DefaultEntry` (cross-check `entry_or_default` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` with a hand-crafted `msg` string
- Attacker controls: the whole `msg`, including whether it starts with '{' and how it is escaped
- Exploit idea: `DefaultMap`/`entry_or_default` cleanup interacts with iteration during `finalize`. Set-up: the same key appears twice in the encoded map.
- Invariant to test: every read of a (key, value) within one call returns the same value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency: sum of `token_balances` owed exceeds assets actually custodied by the Verifier
- Fast validation: Interleave cleanup and iteration in a property test; assert read consistency.
