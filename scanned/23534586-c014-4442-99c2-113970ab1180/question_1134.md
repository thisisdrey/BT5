# Q1134: Investor withdrawal routing: lock churn / stuck route / single claim per payable

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set while a sale offer was recently accepted or cancelled before the batch executes and make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary, breaking the rule that each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs and leading to Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set
- Exploit idea: make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary
- Invariant to test: each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows
- Fast validation: Forge test mixed locked/unlocked batches, duplicate ids, and ownership transfers, then assert each loan pays exactly one valid recipient once.
