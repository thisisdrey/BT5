# Q0920: get-liquidation-position via liquidate-multi: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `get-liquidation-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473` -> `get-liquidation-position`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with the trait principals supplied per entry varied, and assert that the value `get-liquidation-position` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
