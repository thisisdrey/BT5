# Q2934: write-feed via collateral-remove-redeem: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, so the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `write-feed` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
