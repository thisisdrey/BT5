# Q5057: resolve-callcode via collateral-remove-redeem: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `min-underlying`, drive `resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) — which chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx` — to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-underlying`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
