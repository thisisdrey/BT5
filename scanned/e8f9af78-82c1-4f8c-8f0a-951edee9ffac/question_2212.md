# Q2212: vault-system-repay via repay: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal reach `vault-system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207` -> `vault-system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
