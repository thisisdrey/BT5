# [M] Potentially Uninitialized Implementations

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Source: https://github.com/tintinweb/smart-contract-vulndb
Type: audit-issue

## Details
#### Description

Most contracts in the system are meant to be used with a proxy pattern. First, the implementations are deployed, and then proxies are deployed that delegatecall into the respective implementations following an initialization call  (hardhat, with same transaction). However, the implementations are initialized explicitly nor are they protected from other actors claiming/initializing them. This allows anyone to call initialization functions on implementations for use with phishing attacks (i.e. contract implementation addresses are typically listed on the official project website as valid contracts) which may affect the reputation of the system.

None of the implementations allow unprotected delegatecalls or selfdesturcts. lowering the severity of this finding.

#### Examples




**src/contracts/StakingContract.sol:L151-L162**
```solidity
function initialize_1(
    address _admin,
    address _treasury,
    address _depositContract,
    address _elDispatcher,
    address _clDispatcher,
    address _feeRecipientImplementation,
    uint256 _globalFee,
    uint256 _operatorFee,
    uint256 globalCommissionLimitBPS,
    uint256 operatorCommissionLimitBPS
) external init(1) {
```

**src/contracts/AuthorizedFeeRecipient.sol:L21-L32**
```solidity
/// @notice Initializes the receiver
/// @param _dispatcher Address that will handle the fee dispatching
/// @param _publicKeyRoot Public Key root assigned to this receiver
function init(address _dispatcher, bytes32 _publicKeyRoot) external {
    if (initialized) {
        revert AlreadyInitialized();
    }
    initialized = true;
    dispatcher = IFeeDispatcher(_dispatcher);
    publicKeyRoot = _publicKeyRoot;
    stakingContract = msg.sender; // The staking contract always calls init
}
```

**src/contracts/FeeRecipient.sol:L18-L27**
```solidity
/// @param _publicKeyRoot Public Key root assigned to this receiver
function init(address _dispatcher, bytes32 _publicKeyRoot) external {
    if (initialized) {
        revert AlreadyInitialized();
    }
    initialized = true;
    dispatcher = IFeeDispatcher(_dispatcher);
    publicKeyRoot = _publicKeyRoot;
}

```

#### Recommendation

Petrify contracts in the constructor and disallow other actors from claiming/initializing the implementations.
