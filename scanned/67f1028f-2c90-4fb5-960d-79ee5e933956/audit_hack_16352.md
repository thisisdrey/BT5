## Summary
Protocol fee can still be locked, it seems that the issue doesn't get fixed in this codespace.
## Vulnerability Detail
The previous contest issue `Protocol fee from Market.sol is locked `  
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial-judging/issues/52 
seems still exist in this contest  codebase.

```solidity
    function _claimFee(address receiver, UFixed6 fee) private returns (bool) {
        if (msg.sender != receiver) return false;

        token.push(receiver, UFixed18Lib.from(fee));
        emit FeeClaimed(receiver, fee);
        return true;
    }
  ```
  
 Nothing changes in  function  `_claimfee` and the  issue still exist
