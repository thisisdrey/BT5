# Q2041: wait_timeout is not deterministic across nodes (waitable_condvar.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `wait_timeout` in `accounts-db/src/waitable_condvar.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make the stored account meta length disagree with the bytes actually readable from the append vec, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `wait_timeout` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/waitable_condvar.rs` -> `wait_timeout()` (around line 25)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Find input to `wait_timeout` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `wait_timeout` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `wait_timeout` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
