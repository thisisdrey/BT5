## Details
# Too long whitelist can lead to high gas consumption

## Summary
`SellOrder.whitelist` has no limit on its length, and lead to high gas consumption. I.e., If a hot NFT holder makes the `SellOrder` with thousands of addresses in whitelist, the gas would consume at a rapid rate.

`SellOrder.whitelist` could has unlimited length.  Gas would consume at a rapid rate if whitelist too long and takes up too much storage space. It may hurts users who want to buy positions.

It is better to use Merkle Tree instead of Whitelist.

## Impact
Gas consumption could be high, and it may reduce users' engaagement.
