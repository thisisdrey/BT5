# Q4962: collateral-add via liquidate-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374` -> `collateral-add`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault whose share price the redemption moves across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `collateral-add` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
