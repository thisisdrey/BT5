# Q2635: eth_transact can write state that another public path misreads

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `eth_transact` to create or mutate storage that a different public entrypoint later interprets more permissively than intended?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/revive/src/lib.rs::eth_transact
- Entrypoint: public VM / contract execution extrinsic `eth_transact`
- Attacker controls: duplicate or adversarial list ordering
- Exploit idea: Look for state shared across multiple public entrypoints but validated differently by each one.
- Invariant to test: Shared storage must have one consistent meaning across every public path that consumes it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized code/call execution or theft from contract-controlled funds
- Fast validation: After exercising the entrypoint, call every other public function that touches the same object family and check for inconsistent interpretation.
