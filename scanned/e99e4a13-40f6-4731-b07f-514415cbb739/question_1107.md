# Q1107: Investor withdrawal routing: lock churn / wrong recipient / batch isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set while the first loan in the batch is locked and fixes the recipient as the active unlocker and make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans, breaking the rule that batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar and leading to Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: lock, unlock, listing, settlement, or cancellation transitions around the same loan set
- Exploit idea: make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans
- Invariant to test: batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party
- Fast validation: Model sale-offer settlement or cancellation around `investorWithdraw` and assert no stale unlocker or stale owner can claim old payables.
