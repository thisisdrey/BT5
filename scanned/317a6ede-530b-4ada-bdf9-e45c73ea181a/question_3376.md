# Q3376: TrustedCalls delegate execution: batch order / cross-user action / no cross-safe bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with the order of several batched trusted calls that share state across the same Safe or target while another Safe in the system has different delegates or target trust expectations and turn a delegate right meant for one Safe into value movement or state change affecting another user or Safe, breaking the rule that a delegate or batch context should never bleed authority across Safe boundaries and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution caused by cross-safe or cross-user execution confusion?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: the order of several batched trusted calls that share state across the same Safe or target
- Exploit idea: turn a delegate right meant for one Safe into value movement or state change affecting another user or Safe
- Invariant to test: a delegate or batch context should never bleed authority across Safe boundaries
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution caused by cross-safe or cross-user execution confusion
- Fast validation: Model batched calls that share state and assert a revert or invalid later call cannot leave an exploitable partial effect.
