# Q0051: check-confidence via borrow: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `borrow` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `check-confidence` touches, run `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
