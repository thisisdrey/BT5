# [H] \[H02\]\[Partially Fixed\] Malicious Admin can steal from the protocol

## Summary
Severity: High
Source: https://github.com/opynfinance/Convexity-Protocol/blob/3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e/contracts/OptionsContract.sol#L235
Type: audit-issue

## Details
Currently an EOA (_Event Oversight Administrator_) has a lot of privileges over the control of the whole protocol, from setting up initial variables to updating critical values like Oracles and market parameters. For instance, `liquidationIncentive`, `liquidationFactor`,`liquidationFee`,`transactionFee`, and `collateralizationRatio`.

These privileges render the admin with exceptional power over general users, where it could override parameters set up in the deployment. This design puts the whole protocol in a vulnerable state if the admin account is hacked or an internal admin becomes malicious. For example, a malicious admin could easily steal from the protocol by setting a high `liquidationFee`.

Consider the use of an multi-sig account and time-locks to improve the safety of the contract against the powers of a malicious admin.

**Update**: _Partially Fixed in the follow-up commit [3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e](https://github.com/opynfinance/Convexity-Protocol/commit/3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e). The team has put some restrictions on the [parameter update function](https://github.com/opynfinance/Convexity-Protocol/blob/3adfd9afa6d463869d9e0a78cc7f316ae34eb89e/contracts/OptionsContract.sol#L235) which restricts admin power when assigning values. The team has also indicated they are working on a multi-sig solution to further protect the admin account._
