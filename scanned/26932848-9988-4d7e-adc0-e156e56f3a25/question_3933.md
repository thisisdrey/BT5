# Q3933: vault-accrue via collateral-remove-redeem: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `min-underlying`, drive `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) — which dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id — to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, breaking the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `vault-accrue` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
