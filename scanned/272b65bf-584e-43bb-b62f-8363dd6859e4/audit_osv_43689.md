# [H] net/sched: cls_route: fix fastmap use-after-free on filter

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-74583
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2026-08-21
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-74583
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=3.18.0 <5.10.265, >=5.11.0 <5.15.216, >=5.16.0 <6.1.183, >=6.2.0 <6.6.152, >=6.7.0 <6.12.104, >=6.13.0 <6.18.45, >=6.19.0 <7.1.9

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: cls_route: fix fastmap use-after-free on filter

The route4 classifier maintains a 16-slot fastmap cache that stores raw
struct route4_filter pointers indexed by (id, iif). The reader
(route4_classify) populates this cache via route4_set_fastmap() for every
classified packet that hits a filter. The writer (route4_delete,
route4_change) clears the cache via route4_reset_fastmap() before
RCU-deferred kfree of the filter.

This creates a UAF race:
 1. Reader walks the RCU-protected bucket chain, finds filter f
 2. Writer unlinks f, calls route4_reset_fastmap(), then tcf_queue_work()
 3. Reader calls route4_set_fastmap() and writes f into the cache
    *after* the writer's reset, caching a pointer about to be freed
 4. After the RCU grace period, kfree(f) executes
 5. Next classified packet on the same (id, iif) tuple hits the stale
    fastmap entry and reads f->res from freed memory

Reproduced with an mdelay(100) accelerator in route4_set_fastmap() and a
concurrent add/delete stress test (provided by both zdi and Santosh).
Both triggered KASAN slab-use-after-free reports in the route4 fastmap
paths.

Fix:
Introduce a per-filter boolean dying flag to suppress stale fastmap
republishing by in-flight readers.
