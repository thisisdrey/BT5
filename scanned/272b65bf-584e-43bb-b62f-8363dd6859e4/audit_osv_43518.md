# [H] bpf: Tighten cgroup storage cookie checks for prog arrays

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-74305
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2026-08-15
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-74305
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=0 <5.15.212, >=5.16.0 <6.1.178, >=6.2.0 <6.6.145, >=6.7.0 <6.12.97, >=6.13.0 <6.18.40, >=6.17.0 <7.1.5

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Tighten cgroup storage cookie checks for prog arrays

The fix in commit abad3d0bad72 ("bpf: Fix oob access in cgroup local
storage") is still incomplete. The prog-array compatibility check
treats a program with no cgroup storage as compatible with any stored
storage cookie. This allows a storage-less program to bridge a tail
call chain between an entry program and a storage-using callee even
though cgroup local storage at runtime still follows the caller's
context, that is, A -> B(no storage) -> C(storage) path.

Requiring exact cookie equality would break the legitimate case of a
storage-less leaf program being tail called from a storage-using one.
Instead, only accept a zero storage cookie if the program cannot
perform tail calls itself. This keeps A -> B(no storage) working
while rejecting the A -> B(no storage) -> C(storage) bridge.
