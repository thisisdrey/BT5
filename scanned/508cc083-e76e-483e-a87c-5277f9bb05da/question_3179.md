# Q3179: write-feed via liquidate-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
`write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the redemption receiver, use that to make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree, violating the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the redemption receiver, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
