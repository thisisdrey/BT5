# [H] Argo Workflow may expose artifact repository credentials

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-c2hv-4pfj-mm2r
CVE: CVE-2025-62157
CWE: CWE-522
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N (CVSS_V4)
Published: 2025-10-14
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2hv-4pfj-mm2r
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/v3` — affected >=3.7.0 <3.7.3
- Go: `github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/v3` — affected >=0 <3.6.12

## Details
### Summary
An attacker who has permissions to read logs from pods in a namespace with Argo Workflow can read `workflow-controller` logs and get credentials to the artifact repository.

### Details
An attacker, by reading the logs of the workflow controller pod, can access the artifact repository, and steal, delete or modify the data that resides there. The `workflow-controller` logs show the credentials in plaintext.

### Impact
An attacker with access to pod logs in the `argo` namespace can extract plaintext credentials from the `workflow-controller` logs and gain access to the artifact repository. This can lead to:
- Data exfiltration – theft of sensitive or proprietary artifacts
- Data tampering – modification of workflows or artifacts
- Data destruction – deletion of stored artifacts, leading to potential loss of critical data or pipeline failure
