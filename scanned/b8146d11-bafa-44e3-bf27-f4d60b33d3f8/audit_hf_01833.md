# [H] Fixed term loans can be deployed with a wrong fee manager and possibly steal all funds.

## Summary
Severity: High
Contest weight: 0.1525
Dataset id: 10225
Source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zaevlad/audit-findings-dataset
Type: audit-finding

## Details
In MapleLoanInitializer, the address of the fee manager is not whitelisted.
Exploit scenario
• Borrower agrees with delegate on the terms and creates a loan with the correct fee manager;
• Attacker sees the transaction and creates a loan with the same arguments, changing only the fee manager address. They can even choose a salt that makes the first bytes of the malicious loan contract equal to the valid loan contract;
• The pool delegate sees the malicious loan address and funds it thinking it is the valid one;
• All funds are sent to the attacker.

## Recommendation
Whitelist the Fee Manager by adding an isInstanceOf check in MapleGlobals.
