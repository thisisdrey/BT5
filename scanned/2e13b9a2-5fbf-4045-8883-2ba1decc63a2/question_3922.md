# Q3922: population via collateral-remove: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
