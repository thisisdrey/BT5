# Q1081: Investor withdrawal routing: ownership churn / batch bleed / per-loan recipient

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts while a vault, exchange, or later counterparty relies on the same payable balances after the batch and make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it, breaking the rule that every loan in investorWithdraw should pay only the recipient implied by that same loan's current owner and lock state and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts
- Exploit idea: make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it
- Invariant to test: every loan in investorWithdraw should pay only the recipient implied by that same loan's current owner and lock state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers
- Fast validation: Forge test mixed locked/unlocked batches, duplicate ids, and ownership transfers, then assert each loan pays exactly one valid recipient once.
