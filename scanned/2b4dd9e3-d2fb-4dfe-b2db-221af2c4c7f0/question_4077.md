# Q4077: deltas - zero-amount / empty-collection guard bypass (2)

## Question
Given the batch mixes NEP-141, NEP-245 and NEP-171 legs under one signer, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `execute_intents` where the attacker signs both sides of a trade using accounts they control, reach `withdraw` in `contracts/defuse/core/src/engine/state/deltas.rs` with an amount of zero, an empty `Amounts`, or an empty `diff` through a path that does not run the `InvalidIntent` guard, so an event is emitted or state touched with no corresponding value, breaking the invariant `every balance-mutating call carries a strictly positive amount` and leading to unauthorized minting / balance inflation: a balance is credited with no matching asset received?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/core/src/engine/state/deltas.rs](contracts/defuse/core/src/engine/state/deltas.rs) - `withdraw` (cross-check `Deltas` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `execute_intents` where the attacker signs both sides of a trade using accounts they control
- Attacker controls: both sides' deltas, account ids, and the order of payloads in the vector
- Exploit idea: Guards live in some callers but not all; enumerate every path into `internal_add_balance` / `internal_sub_balance` / `deposit` / `withdraw`. Set-up: the batch mixes NEP-141, NEP-245 and NEP-171 legs under one signer.
- Invariant to test: every balance-mutating call carries a strictly positive amount
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unauthorized minting / balance inflation: a balance is credited with no matching asset received
- Fast validation: Enumerate callers of `withdraw`; assert each rejects zero amounts.
