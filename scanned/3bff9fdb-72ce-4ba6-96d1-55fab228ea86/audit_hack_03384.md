# [H] Missing ReEntrancy Guard to `withdrawToken` function

## Summary
Severity: High
Reporter: 0xSmartContract

Type: audit-issue

## Details
# Missing ReEntrancy Guard to `withdrawToken` function

## Summary
`BvbProtocol.sol` contract has no Re-Entrancy protection in `withdrawToken` function

## Vulnerability Detail
if the `safeTransferFrom` was initiated by a contract, then the contract is checked for its ability to receive ERC721 tokens. Without reentrancy guard, onERC721Received will allow an attacker controlled contract to call the mint again, which may not be desirable to some parties, like allowing minting more than allowed.

## Impact
Although reentrancy attack is considered quite old over the past two years, there have been cases such as:
Uniswap/LendfMe hacks (2020) ($25 mln, attacked by a hacker using a reentrancy)
The BurgerSwap hack (May 2021) ( $7.2 million because of a fake token contract and a reentrancy exploit.)
The SURGEBNB hack (August 2021) ($4 million seems to be a reentrancy-based price manipulation attack.)
CREAM FINANCE hack (August 2021) ($18.8 million, reentrancy vulnerability allowed the exploiter for the second borrow.)
Siren protocol hack (September 2021) ($3.5 million, AMM pools were exploited through reentrancy attack.)


## Code Snippet

[BvbProtocol.sol#L450-L462](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L450-L462)

```solidity
src/BvbProtocol.sol:
  449       */
  450:     function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public {
  451:         address collection = matchedOrders[uint(orderHash)].collection;
  452: 
  453:         address recipient = withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId];
  454: 
  455:         // Transfer NFT to recipient
  456:         IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId);
  457: 
  458:         // This token is not withdrawable anymore
  459:         withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId] = address(0);
  460: 
  461:         emit WithdrawnToken(orderHash, tokenId, recipient);
  462:     }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Openzeppelin or Solmate Re-Entrancy pattern

Here is a example of a re-entrancy guard

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract ReEntrancyGuard {
    bool internal locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "No re-entrancy");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
}
```
