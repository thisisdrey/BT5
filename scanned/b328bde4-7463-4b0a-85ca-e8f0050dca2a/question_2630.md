# Q2630: last_voted_slot_hash accepts input it should reject (vote_transaction.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `last_voted_slot_hash` in `vote/src/vote_transaction.rs` with an empty or single-element set at the boundary of the accumulation, and have `last_voted_slot_hash` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`last_voted_slot_hash` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_transaction.rs` -> `last_voted_slot_hash()` (around line 114)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: an empty or single-element set at the boundary of the accumulation
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `last_voted_slot_hash` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `last_voted_slot_hash` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `last_voted_slot_hash` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
