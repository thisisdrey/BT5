# Q2348: find-debt-scaled via liquidate-redeem: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the redemption receiver reach `find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the redemption receiver varied, and assert that the value `find-debt-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
