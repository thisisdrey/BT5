# [H] EL-2026-19: Lack of rate limiting on TCP connections prior to handshake

## Summary
Severity: High
Chain: Ethereum (execution layer)
Component: Reth
Source: https://notes.ethereum.org/K7JY87muSTGKUJuD4MDz7Q
Type: ef-disclosure

## Details
Fix: https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/commit/05ee75f32c95600f0010455ccaf66ed6187b2c59

Short description *
1 sentence description of the bug
Lack of rate limiting on TCP connections prior to handshake are a denial of service vector.
Attack scenario *
More detailed description of the attack/bug scenario and unexpected/buggy behaviour
An attacker can send hello handshake requests concurrently from multiple ports and machines, immediately disconnect, and repeat this indefinitely as the connection limiter lacks rate limiting.
Impact *
 Describe the effect this may have in a production setting
This attack can indefinitely degrade nodes' network connectivity and cause excess resource usage and perform targeted attacks against proposers. A distributed denial of service flood attack may be able to exacerbate this and crash the node. I'm happy to investigate this further.

Reproduction *
If used any sort of tools/simulations to find the bug, describe in detail how to reproduce the buggy behaviour.
Start the node `RUST_LOG="info,net::session=trace" ./target/debug/reth node`. Then run the spamming tool `cargo run --bin spammer -- --target enode://... --port-start 30369 --port-end 30420 --max-concurrent 100`. The effect will vary depending on the configuration, but this will spike CPU and memory usage. The repeated "new pending incoming session" and "disconnected pending session" from the same IP logs show the lack of rate limiting.

Fix
Description of suggested fix, if available
Limit the number of connections an IP can make in a given time span
Details
Any details not covered above
See that geth has a limit of one connection for every 30 seconds prior to the handshake
