# Q3052: Address-book role bit isolation: zero-like target / whitelist bypass / exact whitelist

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with edge-case grantee addresses such as zero-like or contract addresses the attacker controls while the same grantee address is intentionally present under multiple roles for legitimate reasons and make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present, breaking the rule that loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book and leading to Unauthorized loan creation or exchange settlement path through role confusion?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: edge-case grantee addresses such as zero-like or contract addresses the attacker controls
- Exploit idea: make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present
- Invariant to test: loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized loan creation or exchange settlement path through role confusion
- Fast validation: Check that mixed legitimate multi-role grantees do not accidentally satisfy unrelated authorization checks.
