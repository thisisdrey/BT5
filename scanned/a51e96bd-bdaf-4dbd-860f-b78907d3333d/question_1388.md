# Q1388: convert-to-shares-preview via supply-collateral-add: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg reach `convert-to-shares-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308` -> `convert-to-shares-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg varied, and assert that the value `convert-to-shares-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
