# Q1816: iter-lookup-collateral via collateral-remove-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-underlying` reach `iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
