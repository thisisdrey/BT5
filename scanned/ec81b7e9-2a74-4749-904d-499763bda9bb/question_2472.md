# Q2472: Vault async redeem flow: partial withdraw / dust strand / no stranded redeem

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption while the controller already has a prior claimable redeem or pending deposit position and strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be withdrawn or cancelled, breaking the rule that no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable redemption value and leading to User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption
- Exploit idea: strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be withdrawn or cancelled
- Invariant to test: no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable redemption value
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Exhaust a controller's claimable redemption in alternating share and asset units and assert no dust or reserve mismatch remains.
