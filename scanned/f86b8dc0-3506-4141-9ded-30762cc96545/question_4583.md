# Q4583: get-account-scaled-debt via liquidate-multi: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`get-account-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307) reads one scaled debt row. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307` -> `get-account-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
