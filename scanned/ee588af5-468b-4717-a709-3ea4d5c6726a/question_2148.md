# Q2148: merge-price via borrow: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `borrow` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `merge-price` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
