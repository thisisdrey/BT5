# Q4080: normalize-pyth via collateral-add: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position's existing collateral and debt composition reach `normalize-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297` -> `normalize-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `normalize-pyth` computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position's existing collateral and debt composition across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `normalize-pyth` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
