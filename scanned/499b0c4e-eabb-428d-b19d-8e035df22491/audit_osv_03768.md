# [H] ALPINE-CVE-2026-48111

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: ALPINE-CVE-2026-48111
Ecosystem: Alpine:v3.24
CVSS: 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2026-06-05

Type: osv

## Affected
- Alpine:v3.24: `7zip` — affected >=0 <26.01-r0

## Details
7-Zip is a file archiver with a high compression ratio. Versions 9.21 through 26.00 contain an off-by-one out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the ParseDepedencyExpression function of the UEFI firmware image parser(CPP/7zip/Archive/UefiHandler.cpp). The function validates an attacker-controlled opcode byte using > instead of >= against the element count of the 10-entry kExpressionCommands static array, allowing an opcode value of 10 to read one pointer slot (8 bytes on x64) past the end of the array in .rodata. The out-of-bounds value is then dereferenced as a const char * and passed through strlen and memcpy into the archive's Characts property, which may cause either a denial of service (access violation when the adjacent bytes do not form a valid readable pointer) or a minor information disclosure of an adjacent .rdata string literal into archive metadata. The vulnerability is reached automatically during IInArchive::Open() via the call path OpenFv/OpenCapsule → ParseVolume → ParseSections when processing a SECTION_DXE_DEPEX (0x13) or SECTION_PEI_DEPEX (0x1B) section whose first body byte is 0x0A, and the UEFI handler is enabled by default in stock 7z.dll with signature-based detection for both UEFIc and UEFIf formats. The outcome (crash vs. silent leak) is deterministic per build but linker-layout dependent, with no write primitive and no disclosure of heap data, secrets, or ASLR base addresses. Version 26.01 fixes the issue.
