# Q1686: refresh via collateral-add: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `refresh` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
