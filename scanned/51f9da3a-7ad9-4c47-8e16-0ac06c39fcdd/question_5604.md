# Q5604: resolve-price-feed via liquidate-redeem: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `resolve-price-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332` -> `resolve-price-feed`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `resolve-price-feed` dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `resolve-price-feed` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
