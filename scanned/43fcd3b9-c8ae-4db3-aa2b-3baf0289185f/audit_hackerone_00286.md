## Details
We found an issue in the JWE specification where it fails to warn the implementers about Invalid Curve attack.
We found several libraries to be vulnerable :   node-jose, jose2go, Nimbus JOSE+JWT and jose4j and in the process of filing an errata for the RFC.
We report the vulnerabilities to the maintainers that promptly fixed the issue.
We also wrote a blog post about it in order to reach the highest number of people potentially vulnerable. You can find the write up in [0,1,2].
