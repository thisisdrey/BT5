# Q3815: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: finite allowance / expiry bypass / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls while there are several recipient routes for the same Safe and token or collection and spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls
- Exploit idea: spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping
- Fast validation: Check that neighboring recipients, collections, or tokens cannot be reached through a superficially similar approved route.
