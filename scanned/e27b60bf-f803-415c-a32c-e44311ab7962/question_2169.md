# Q2169: prefetcher racing the main trie read — outgoing_metadata.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys, an access pattern that keeps the prefetcher and the executing thread on the same nodes, with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes, reach `trie_key` in `core/store/src/trie/outgoing_metadata.rs` and have prefetched data enter the witness or the read result non-deterministically, breaking the invariant that prefetching never affects execution results or recorded witness content, leading to Critical - Chunk cannot be validated statelessly (state-witness divergence), permanently stalling or forking the shard?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/trie/outgoing_metadata.rs` :: `trie_key`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys
- Attacker controls: an access pattern that keeps the prefetcher and the executing thread on the same nodes; with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes
- Exploit idea: have prefetched data enter the witness or the read result non-deterministically
- Invariant to test: prefetching never affects execution results or recorded witness content
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Chunk cannot be validated statelessly (state-witness divergence), permanently stalling or forking the shard
- Fast validation: differential test running with prefetching enabled and disabled
