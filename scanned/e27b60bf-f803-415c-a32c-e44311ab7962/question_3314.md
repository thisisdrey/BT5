# Q3314: memtrie and resharding interacting under attacker-shaped state — upgrade_schedule.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys, state shaped so the split boundary lands inside a long extension node, when a referencing account is deleted while others still reference the code, and additionally when two account-creation paths race for the same id in one block, reach `protocol_version_to_vote_for_at_date` in `core/primitives/src/upgrade_schedule.rs` and produce child memtries whose roots disagree with the disk-derived children, breaking the invariant that splitting is exact regardless of where the boundary lands in the node structure, leading to Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/upgrade_schedule.rs` :: `protocol_version_to_vote_for_at_date`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys
- Attacker controls: state shaped so the split boundary lands inside a long extension node; when a referencing account is deleted while others still reference the code; when two account-creation paths race for the same id in one block
- Exploit idea: produce child memtries whose roots disagree with the disk-derived children
- Invariant to test: splitting is exact regardless of where the boundary lands in the node structure
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork
- Fast validation: resharding test with the boundary inside an extension node
