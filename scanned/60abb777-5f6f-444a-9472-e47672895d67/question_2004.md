# Q2004: Vault async deposit flow: operator timing / ratio drift / no stranded claim

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with an operator approval added and removed around request and claim boundaries while the manager approves only part of the pending assets before later approvals and make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable approved value and leading to User funds stuck because approved deposits become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: an operator approval added and removed around request and claim boundaries
- Exploit idea: make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable approved value
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved deposits become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Simulate partial approvals across time and assert claimable assets and shares can always be fully exhausted without dust-locking value.
