# Q1777: Exchange offer lifecycle: relist cycle / stale snapshot / one live offer state

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled cancellation and re-listing cycles for the same loans while one side is a vault or later counterparty that relies on precise lock cleanup and delivery semantics and make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way, breaking the rule that an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled cancellation and re-listing cycles for the same loans
- Exploit idea: make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way
- Invariant to test: an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement
- Fast validation: Simulate cancel/relist cycles and ensure no listed loan remains locked or economically bound to a dead offer.
