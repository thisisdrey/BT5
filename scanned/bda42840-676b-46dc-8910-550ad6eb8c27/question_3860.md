# Q3860: Smart account deployment and initialization: init arrays / init replay / ownership binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer while a second configuration attempt is made against a Safe that already ran initialization once and make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe, breaking the rule that deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold and leading to Bypass of intended Safe initialization or module-setup permissions?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer
- Exploit idea: make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe
- Invariant to test: deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended Safe initialization or module-setup permissions
- Fast validation: Model predicted-address observation and deployment races and ensure a third party cannot change who effectively controls the resulting account.
