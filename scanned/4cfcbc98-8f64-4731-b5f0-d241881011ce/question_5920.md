# Q5920: congestion threshold hysteresis exploited for stalling — congestion_info.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`, traffic that oscillates a shard just across the congestion threshold every block, when the shard oscillates across the congestion threshold every block, and additionally when the target shard's chunk is missing for several consecutive heights, reach `is_fully_congested` in `core/primitives/src/congestion_info.rs` and keep the shard flip-flopping so useful throughput collapses and blocks are delayed, breaking the invariant that congestion control degrades gracefully and preserves forward progress, leading to High - Temporary freezing of network transactions (chunk/block production delayed 500%+ over recent average)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/congestion_info.rs` :: `is_fully_congested`
- Entrypoint: an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`
- Attacker controls: traffic that oscillates a shard just across the congestion threshold every block; when the shard oscillates across the congestion threshold every block; when the target shard's chunk is missing for several consecutive heights
- Exploit idea: keep the shard flip-flopping so useful throughput collapses and blocks are delayed
- Invariant to test: congestion control degrades gracefully and preserves forward progress
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of network transactions (chunk/block production delayed 500%+ over recent average)
- Fast validation: test-loop test measuring chunk time under oscillating congestion
