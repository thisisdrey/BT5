# Q1714: get_price_and_confidence_of_type: cached and live price paths disagree at a critical boundary [remaining-accounts-that-can-swap] [adapter-mismatch]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `lending_account_liquidate` with remaining accounts that can swap oracle and auxiliary integration state so `get_price_and_confidence_of_type` uses cached pricing in one place and live pricing in another, breaking `liquidation pricing must use the exact configured source with consistent confidence/freshness enforcement on every branch` and causing `High: over-liquidation, under-repayment, or protocol loss from misvaluation`? Focus specifically on integration-backed price adapters where reserve/market and oracle contexts can be cross-wired.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/price.rs` / `get_price_and_confidence_of_type`
- Entrypoint: `lending_account_liquidate`
- Attacker controls: remaining accounts that can swap oracle and auxiliary integration state
- Exploit idea: Probe threshold states where a stale cached value would change borrowability, liquidatability, or settlement size versus a fresh lookup. Focus specifically on integration-backed price adapters where reserve/market and oracle contexts can be cross-wired.
- Invariant to test: liquidation pricing must use the exact configured source with consistent confidence/freshness enforcement on every branch
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: over-liquidation, under-repayment, or protocol loss from misvaluation
- Fast validation: Prepare divergent cache/live prices and assert any accepted instruction remains valid under a single fresh pricing view. Provide two plausible adapter contexts and assert the price path rejects every mix-and-match combination.
