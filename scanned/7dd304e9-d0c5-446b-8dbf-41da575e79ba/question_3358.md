# Q3358: total-debt via liquidate-redeem: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`, so the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
