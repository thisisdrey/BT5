# Q0069: interest-rate via accrue: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, drive `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) — which interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization — to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, breaking the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `accrue` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `interest-rate` touches, run `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
