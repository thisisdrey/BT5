# [H] iommu/s390: Fix memory corruption when using identity domain

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2025-39939
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2025-10-04
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2025-39939
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=6.15.0 <6.16.9

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/s390: Fix memory corruption when using identity domain

zpci_get_iommu_ctrs() returns counter information to be reported as part
of device statistics; these counters are stored as part of the s390_domain.
The problem, however, is that the identity domain is not backed by an
s390_domain and so the conversion via to_s390_domain() yields a bad address
that is zero'd initially and read on-demand later via a sysfs read.
These counters aren't necessary for the identity domain; just return NULL
in this case.

This issue was discovered via KASAN with reports that look like:
BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in zpci_fmb_enable_device
when using the identity domain for a device on s390.
