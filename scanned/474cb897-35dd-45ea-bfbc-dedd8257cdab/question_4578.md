# Q4578: bandwidth scheduler determinism across nodes — receipt.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`, a link-saturating traffic pattern that makes grant allocation depend on iteration order, when the shard is driven exactly onto a congestion threshold, and additionally when the shard oscillates across the congestion threshold every block, reach `receiver_shard_id` in `core/primitives/src/receipt.rs` and have two honest nodes compute different grants for the same block and diverge, breaking the invariant that the scheduler is a pure deterministic function of the previous state and the block hash, leading to Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/receipt.rs` :: `receiver_shard_id`
- Entrypoint: an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`
- Attacker controls: a link-saturating traffic pattern that makes grant allocation depend on iteration order; when the shard is driven exactly onto a congestion threshold; when the shard oscillates across the congestion threshold every block
- Exploit idea: have two honest nodes compute different grants for the same block and diverge
- Invariant to test: the scheduler is a pure deterministic function of the previous state and the block hash
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork
- Fast validation: differential test running the scheduler twice with shuffled input ordering
