# Q3751: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: nft route / expiry bypass / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances while there are several recipient routes for the same Safe and token or collection and spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances
- Exploit idea: spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient
- Fast validation: Forge test one delegate across several Safes and routes and assert each transfer consumes only the exact approved route.
