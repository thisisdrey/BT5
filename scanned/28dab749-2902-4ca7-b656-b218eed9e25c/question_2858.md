# Q2858: population via liquidate: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `collateral-receiver`, can an unprivileged attacker make `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search, so the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `liquidate` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `collateral-receiver` varied, and assert that the value `population` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
