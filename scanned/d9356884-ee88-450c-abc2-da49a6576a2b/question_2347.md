# Q2347: accrue-and-cache via collateral-remove: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `accrue-and-cache` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
