# [H] lib: test_hmm: evict device pages on file close to avoid use-after-free

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-46280
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2026-06-08

Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=5.8.0 <6.1.176, >=6.2.0 <6.6.140, >=6.7.0 <6.12.86, >=6.13.0 <6.18.27, >=6.19.0 <7.0.4

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib: test_hmm: evict device pages on file close to avoid use-after-free

Patch series "Minor hmm_test fixes and cleanups".

Two bugfixes a cleanup for the HMM kernel selftests.  These were mostly
reported by Zenghui Yu with special thanks to Lorenzo for analysing and
pointing out the problems.


This patch (of 3):

When dmirror_fops_release() is called it frees the dmirror struct but
doesn't migrate device private pages back to system memory first.  This
leaves those pages with a dangling zone_device_data pointer to the freed
dmirror.

If a subsequent fault occurs on those pages (eg.  during coredump) the
dmirror_devmem_fault() callback dereferences the stale pointer causing a
kernel panic.  This was reported [1] when running mm/ksft_hmm.sh on arm64,
where a test failure triggered SIGABRT and the resulting coredump walked
the VMAs faulting in the stale device private pages.

Fix this by calling dmirror_device_evict_chunk() for each devmem chunk in
dmirror_fops_release() to migrate all device private pages back to system
memory before freeing the dmirror struct.  The function is moved earlier
in the file to avoid a forward declaration.
