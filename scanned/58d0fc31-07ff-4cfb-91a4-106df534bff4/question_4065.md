# Q4065: error - nonce cleanup driven by an attacker's timing (15)

## Question
Given the wallet has an extension enabled by an earlier op in the same request, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through replay of a `RequestMessage` observed on-chain, against the same or a sibling wallet, call `ResolveError` in `crates/signatures/nep641/src/resolver/error.rs` to force a nonce rotation at a moment that discards a victim's in-flight nonce, enabling replay of their signed request, breaking the invariant `a nonce is discarded only after every request that could carry it has expired` and leading to direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/signatures/nep641/src/resolver/error.rs](crates/signatures/nep641/src/resolver/error.rs) - `ResolveError` (cross-check `ResolveErrorKind` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: replay of a `RequestMessage` observed on-chain, against the same or a sibling wallet
- Attacker controls: when it is replayed and which wallet instance it is sent to
- Exploit idea: Rotation is time-driven and triggered by ordinary calls; probe whether an unprivileged caller can advance it early. Set-up: the wallet has an extension enabled by an earlier op in the same request.
- Invariant to test: a nonce is discarded only after every request that could carry it has expired
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once
- Fast validation: Trigger rotation immediately before a victim's request lands; assert the request cannot execute twice.
