# Reentrancy in `settleContract` with ERC777 `asset`

## Summary
In `settleContract()`, `settledContracts` mapping is updated after transfer of tokens to the bear, which allows reentrancy with ERC777 `asset` tokens. As a result, the bear can transfer multiple NFTs to the bull and get from the bull an amount of tokens up to the bull's allowance to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. bear creates an order
2. bull matches the order
3. bear calls `settleContract` with a floor `tokenId`. NFT with `tokenId` is transfered to bull, bear receives payment of ERC777:
   -   On ERC777 callback the bear calls again `settleContract` with another floor `tokenId`. Note that `settledContracts[contractId]` is still `false` and the check at line [389](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L389) passes. The second NFT is transfered to the bull and if the bull has enough allowance to the contract, `bearAssetAmount` is transfered again to the bear. In the transfer the bear can reenter again and repeat until allowance of the bull to the contract is too low.

## Impact
A bear can settle the same contract with many floor NFTs in its possession, and get in exchange almost all of the bull's tokens allowed to the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function settleContract(Order calldata order, uint tokenId) public nonReentrant {
        bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);

        // ContractId
        uint contractId = uint(orderHash);

        address bear = bears[contractId];

        // Check that only the bear can settle the contract
        require(msg.sender == bear, "ONLY_BEAR");

        // Check that the contract is not expired
        require(block.timestamp < order.expiry, "EXPIRED_CONTRACT");

        // Check that the contract is not already settled
        require(!settledContracts[contractId], "SETTLED_CONTRACT");

```
