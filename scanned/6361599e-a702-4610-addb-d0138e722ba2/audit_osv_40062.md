## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-49227
Aliases: GHSA-26pw-fgm8-2hcf

Type: osv

## Details
Vvveb is a powerful and easy to use CMS with page builder to build websites, blogs or ecommerce stores. Prior to 1.0.8.4, Vvveb backend comment operations allow a low-privileged Author to manage comments under another Author's posts. The admin/controller/content/comment.php and admin/controller/content/comments.php controllers and the admin/sql/sqlite/comment.sql queries accept a caller-controlled comment_id without verifying comment.post_id against post.admin_id for the current admin_id. An attacker can read pending comment content and commenter email addresses, change moderation status, edit comment content, or delete comments, breaking author and moderation boundaries. This issue is fixed in version 1.0.8.4.
