# Q2462: accrue-and-cache via deposit: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves, so the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `deposit` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call varied, and assert that the value `accrue-and-cache` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
