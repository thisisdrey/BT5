# Q3945: filter-out-debt-asset via collateral-add: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) — which rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64` — to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, breaking the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `filter-out-debt-asset` touches, run `collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
