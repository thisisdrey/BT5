# Q4026: zip via liquidate-redeem: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the redemption receiver across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `zip` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
