# Q0779: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: charged-off pay / date inconsistency / cash-to-clearing consistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with payments into a loan that is `ChargedOff` but still accepts borrower payments while the loan is `Active` with non-zero principal or interest receivables and make repeated `pay` calls leave `lastPaymentDate` and economic balances in an order that later logic misinterprets, breaking the rule that the cash held after `pay` should always have a consistent representation in borrower payment clearing for that same loan and leading to User funds stuck or mispriced until a trusted role resolves the clearing state?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: payments into a loan that is `ChargedOff` but still accepts borrower payments
- Exploit idea: make repeated `pay` calls leave `lastPaymentDate` and economic balances in an order that later logic misinterprets
- Invariant to test: the cash held after `pay` should always have a consistent representation in borrower payment clearing for that same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck or mispriced until a trusted role resolves the clearing state
- Fast validation: Fuzz payment sizes and timestamps around due dates and assert `lastPaymentDate`, clearing, and cash never enter a contradictory state.
