# Q2506: check_commitment_and_notify accepts input it should reject (rpc_subscriptions.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `check_commitment_and_notify` in `rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs` with a payload that satisfies the cheap precondition but not the full check, and have `check_commitment_and_notify` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`check_commitment_and_notify` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs` -> `check_commitment_and_notify()` (around line 136)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: a payload that satisfies the cheap precondition but not the full check
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `check_commitment_and_notify` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `check_commitment_and_notify` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `check_commitment_and_notify` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
