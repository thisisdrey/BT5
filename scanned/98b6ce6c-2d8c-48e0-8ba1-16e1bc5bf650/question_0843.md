# Q0843: relevant via liquidate-multi: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `relevant` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
