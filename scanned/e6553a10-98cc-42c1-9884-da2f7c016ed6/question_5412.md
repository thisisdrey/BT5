# Q5412: collateral-remove via collateral-remove-redeem: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-underlying` reach `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-underlying` across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `collateral-remove` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
