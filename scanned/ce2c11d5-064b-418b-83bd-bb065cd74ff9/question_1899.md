# Q1899: Exchange offer lifecycle: cashflow timing / misbound whitelist / full unlock on cancel

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active while the offer contains multiple loans whose economic state can diverge while storage stays static and make the mutual-registration checks bind the wrong effective buyer or seller at settlement time, breaking the rule that cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue and leading to Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active
- Exploit idea: make the mutual-registration checks bind the wrong effective buyer or seller at settlement time
- Invariant to test: cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer
- Fast validation: Model cashflow accrual during an active offer and assert settlement cannot mix old storage with new economic state improperly.
