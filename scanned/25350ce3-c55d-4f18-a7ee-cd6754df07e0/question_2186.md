# Q2186: debt-remove-scaled via transfer: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, so the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `transfer` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury varied, and assert that the value `debt-remove-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
