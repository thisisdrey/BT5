# Q4818: linear-interpolate via collateral-remove: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `linear-interpolate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
