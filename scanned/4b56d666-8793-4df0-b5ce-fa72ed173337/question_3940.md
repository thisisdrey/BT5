# Q3940: price-multi-resolve via call-ststx-ratio: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block reach `price-multi-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397` -> `price-multi-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `call-ststx-ratio` with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
