# Q1263: Investor withdrawal routing: epoch split / stuck route / batch isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with one loan from a fresh ownership epoch and one loan from a prior epoch that shares the same apparent investor or unlocker while a sale offer was recently accepted or cancelled before the batch executes and make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary, breaking the rule that batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: one loan from a fresh ownership epoch and one loan from a prior epoch that shares the same apparent investor or unlocker
- Exploit idea: make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary
- Invariant to test: batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale
- Fast validation: Model sale-offer settlement or cancellation around `investorWithdraw` and assert no stale unlocker or stale owner can claim old payables.
