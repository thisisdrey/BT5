# [C] CVE-2019-11043: a buffer underflow in fpm_main.c can lead to RCE in php-fpm

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Program: Internet Bug Bounty
Weakness: Buffer Underflow
Reporter: neex
State: resolved
Disclosed: 2020-11-09T01:46:16.547Z
CVE: CVE-2019-11043
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/722327

## Details
The vulnerability exists in php-fpm because of missing bounds check in fpm_main.c. If the FastCGI variable `PATH_INFO` is empty, the underflow happens when the code tries to calculate the value of the `path_info` variable. An invalid pointer in `path_info` leads to a single byte out-of-bounds write, which can be leveraged to code execution.

The php-fpm allows anyone who can connect to its' port to execute code, so an RCE in php-fpm is not interesting by itself. However, this particular issue can be exploited even by a user who has access to the HTTP server (which is Nginx typically). In certain Nginx configurations, it is possible to make it send empty `PATH_INFO` value by breaking regexp in `fastcgi_split_pathinfo` directive using an encoded newline character (`%0a`).   

The issue was reported to PHP maintainers in the [bug 78599](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=78599) and assigned CVE-2019-11043. It was disclosed on October 22.

The exploit for the issue is available at https://github.com/neex/phuip-fpizdam/.

To reproduce the issue, follow the steps at the ["Playground environment" section](https://github.com/neex/phuip-fpizdam/#playground-environment) in the exploit's README. The repo contains a Dockerfile, which builds the version of PHP just before the fix.

Exploit works only when Nginx config allows to trigger the bug (that is, to send empty `PATH_INFO` FastCGI variable). The full list of preconditions [can be found](https://github.com/neex/phuip-fpizdam/#the-full-list-of-preconditions) at the exploit repository. There are real world examples of big projects empoying such configuration, see e.g. https://twitter.com/chybeta/status/1187213401124036608 (this particular issue is already reported to the corresponding bug bounty program and they hardened the Nginx config).

As the vulnerability resides in php-fpm, not Nginx, there might be other ways to trigger the vulnerability when other HTTP server software is used. However, I'm not aware of any at this moment.

## Impact

If the attack is successful, the attacker can execute code at the server that runs php-fpm with the privileges of the php-fpm process. Again, note that the attacker doesn't have access to the php-fpm socket, she only makes HTTP requests to the nginx.
