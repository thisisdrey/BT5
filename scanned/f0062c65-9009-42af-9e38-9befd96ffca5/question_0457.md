# Q0457: Loans funding and disbursement state: lock cycle / phase skip / single funding

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a normal list-lock-unlock cycle around the same loan before funding or disbursement while the loan is still `Created` with positive borrower principal receivable and zero investor principal payable and make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable, breaking the rule that `fund` should only succeed once per loan and only for the current NFT owner of that same loan and leading to Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a normal list-lock-unlock cycle around the same loan before funding or disbursement
- Exploit idea: make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable
- Invariant to test: `fund` should only succeed once per loan and only for the current NFT owner of that same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC
- Fast validation: Forge test ownership changes, lock cycles, and standing allowances around `fund`, then assert only the current NFT owner can move capital exactly once.
