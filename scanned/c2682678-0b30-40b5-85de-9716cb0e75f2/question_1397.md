# Q1397: receive-underlying via transfer: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, drive `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) — which pulls the underlying from a named account — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `transfer` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `transfer` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
