# Q5491: is-healthy via collateral-remove-redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`is-healthy` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:656) returns true whenever `debt-usd` is zero and otherwise compares the raw products `(* debt-usd BPS)` and `(* collateral-usd ltv)`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:656` -> `is-healthy`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy` returns true whenever `debt-usd` is zero and otherwise compares the raw products `(* debt-usd BPS)` and `(* collateral-usd ltv)`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, then read `is-healthy` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
