# Q1802: Exchange offer lifecycle: address-book churn / misbound whitelist / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance while every listed loan is locked to the exchange while the offer is live and make the mutual-registration checks bind the wrong effective buyer or seller at settlement time, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance
- Exploit idea: make the mutual-registration checks bind the wrong effective buyer or seller at settlement time
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer
- Fast validation: Model cashflow accrual during an active offer and assert settlement cannot mix old storage with new economic state improperly.
