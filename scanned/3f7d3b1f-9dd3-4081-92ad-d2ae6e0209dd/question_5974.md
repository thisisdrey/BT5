# Q5974: insert via transfer: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, can an unprivileged attacker make `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id, so the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `transfer` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `transfer` with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
