# Q1892: Exchange offer lifecycle: cashflow timing / stale snapshot / exact counterparties

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active while the offer contains multiple loans whose economic state can diverge while storage stays static and make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way, breaking the rule that mutual investor-registration checks should bind the exact buyer and seller that receive settlement value and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active
- Exploit idea: make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way
- Invariant to test: mutual investor-registration checks should bind the exact buyer and seller that receive settlement value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
