# Q0686: salts - expired-nonce grinding to force a victim's cleanup (7)

## Question
Given the nonce word for the target 248-bit prefix already carries a bit committed by an earlier intent, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `simulate_intents` used to probe nonce state before committing a replay, use `is_valid_salt` in `contracts/defuse/src/contract/salts.rs` to make a victim's still-valid nonce word eligible for cleanup by planting expired nonces in the same prefix, enabling replay of the victim's signed intent, breaking the invariant `cleanup of account A's nonce word never clears a bit set by a still-live authorisation of account A` and leading to direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/src/contract/salts.rs](contracts/defuse/src/contract/salts.rs) - `is_valid_salt` (cross-check `current_salt` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `simulate_intents` used to probe nonce state before committing a replay
- Attacker controls: the probe batch and the timing of the follow-up `execute_intents`
- Exploit idea: The attacker can create accounts and commit nonces of their choosing; probe whether cleanup is scoped per account or can be steered onto a victim's word. Set-up: the nonce word for the target 248-bit prefix already carries a bit committed by an earlier intent.
- Invariant to test: cleanup of account A's nonce word never clears a bit set by a still-live authorisation of account A
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once
- Fast validation: Sandbox: plant expired nonces sharing a prefix with a victim's live nonce; assert cleanup leaves the live bit set.
