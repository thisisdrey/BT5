# [H] Symlink Escape in Agent File Tools

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-27967
Aliases: GHSA-786m-x2vc-5235
CVSS: 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)
Published: 2026-02-25

Type: osv

## Details
Zed, a code editor, has a symlink escape vulnerability in versions prior to 0.225.9 in Agent file tools (`read_file`, `edit_file`). It allows reading and writing files **outside the project directory** when a project contains symbolic links pointing to external paths. This bypasses the intended workspace boundary and privacy protections (`file_scan_exclusions`, `private_files`), potentially leaking sensitive user data to the LLM. Version 0.225.9 fixes the issue.
