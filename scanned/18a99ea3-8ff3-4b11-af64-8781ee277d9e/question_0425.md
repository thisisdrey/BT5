# Q0425: add-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, drive `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) — which adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default — to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, breaking the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
