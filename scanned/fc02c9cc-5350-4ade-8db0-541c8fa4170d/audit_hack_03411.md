## Details
# `reclaimContract()` need to check if the order is matched

## Summary

`reclaimContract()` does not check if the order is matched already. A malicious user can fake an order to send all the fund of the contract to address(0) and lock forever.


## Vulnerability Detail

In `reclaimContract()`, there is no check if the order has been matched. A malicious user can pass in some order which is not matched, but with high premium and collateral, summed up to the balance of the contract, and `order.expiry` less than the current timestamp. Since the order is not matched, `bulls[contractId]` will be address(0), all the fund in the contract could be transferred to address(0) and locked there forever.


## Impact

Drain of contract fund, locked in address(0).

## Recommendation

In `reclaimContract()`, add the following check:
```solidity
    require(matchedOrders[contractId] != address(0);)
```
