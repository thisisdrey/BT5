# Q2133: calc-index-next via liquidate: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, drive `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) — which applies a multiplier to the current index — to convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction, breaking the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `liquidate` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-index-next` touches, run `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
