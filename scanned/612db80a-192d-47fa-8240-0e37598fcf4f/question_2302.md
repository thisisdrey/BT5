# Q2302: Vault async redeem flow: split owner-controller / reserve mismatch / global reserve sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses while idleLiquidity is just above the approved reserve and later user activity could consume nearby balances and make totalClaimableRedeemAssets or the per-controller counters diverge from the actual reserved USDC, breaking the rule that totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers and leading to Cross-shareholder dilution through broken async redemption accounting?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: make totalClaimableRedeemAssets or the per-controller counters diverge from the actual reserved USDC
- Invariant to test: totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-shareholder dilution through broken async redemption accounting
- Fast validation: Exhaust a controller's claimable redemption in alternating share and asset units and assert no dust or reserve mismatch remains.
