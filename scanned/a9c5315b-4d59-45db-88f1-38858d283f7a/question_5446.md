# Q5446: enum discriminant beyond the known range — views.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through `broadcast_tx_commit` / `send_tx` RPC carrying a SignedTransaction signed by an ordinary FullAccess key, an action or receipt enum tag one past the highest defined variant, with a duplicate or out-of-range enum discriminant, and additionally with nesting at exactly the maximum accepted depth, reach `wasm_host` in `core/primitives/src/views.rs` and make older and newer nodes disagree about whether the payload is valid, breaking the invariant that unknown discriminants are rejected identically on every node at a given protocol version, leading to High - Unintended chain split (network partition)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/views.rs` :: `wasm_host`
- Entrypoint: `broadcast_tx_commit` / `send_tx` RPC carrying a SignedTransaction signed by an ordinary FullAccess key
- Attacker controls: an action or receipt enum tag one past the highest defined variant; with a duplicate or out-of-range enum discriminant; with nesting at exactly the maximum accepted depth
- Exploit idea: make older and newer nodes disagree about whether the payload is valid
- Invariant to test: unknown discriminants are rejected identically on every node at a given protocol version
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Unintended chain split (network partition)
- Fast validation: test decoding an out-of-range discriminant under each protocol version
