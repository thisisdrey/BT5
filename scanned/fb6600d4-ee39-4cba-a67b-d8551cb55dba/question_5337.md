# Q5337: amounts - zero-amount / empty-collection guard bypass (7)

## Question
Given the attacker signs both counterparties using accounts they control, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` `msg` with `execute_intents` funded by the attacker's own deposit, reach `with_add` in `contracts/defuse/core/src/amounts.rs` with an amount of zero, an empty `Amounts`, or an empty `diff` through a path that does not run the `InvalidIntent` guard, so an event is emitted or state touched with no corresponding value, breaking the invariant `every balance-mutating call carries a strictly positive amount` and leading to unauthorized minting / balance inflation: a balance is credited with no matching asset received?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/core/src/amounts.rs](contracts/defuse/core/src/amounts.rs) - `with_add` (cross-check `serialize_as` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` `msg` with `execute_intents` funded by the attacker's own deposit
- Attacker controls: the deposited amount, the nested batch, and `refund_if_fails`
- Exploit idea: Guards live in some callers but not all; enumerate every path into `internal_add_balance` / `internal_sub_balance` / `deposit` / `withdraw`. Set-up: the attacker signs both counterparties using accounts they control.
- Invariant to test: every balance-mutating call carries a strictly positive amount
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unauthorized minting / balance inflation: a balance is credited with no matching asset received
- Fast validation: Enumerate callers of `with_add`; assert each rejects zero amounts.
