# [H] OpenEXR: Heap out-of-bounds write in TiledRgbaInputFile via integer overflow on 32-bit (ILP32) builds

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-59186
Aliases: GHSA-f667-c4wm-c8gq
CVSS: 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)
Published: 2026-08-25

Type: osv

## Details
OpenEXR is the reference implementation and specification for the EXR image format, widely used in the motion picture industry. In versions before 3.2.11, 3.3.0 through 3.3.12, and 3.4.0 through 3.4.13, a crafted tiled EXR can trigger a heap out-of-bounds write on 32-bit/ILP32 builds when read through the public TiledRgbaInputFile RGBA API. The file uses a small 40x40 dataWindow but a 65537x65537 tile size. On ILP32, the Array2D<Rgba> tile-conversion buffer size calculation overflows, allocates a much smaller heap buffer, and tile decode writes past that allocation. This issue is fixed in versions 3.2.11, 3.3.13, and 3.4.14.
