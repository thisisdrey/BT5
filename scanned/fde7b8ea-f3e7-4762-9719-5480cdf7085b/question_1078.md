# Q1078: sync_indexer_flags: close path leaves live exposure behind [a-same-slot-sequence-that] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker route `sync_indexer_flags` through `sync_indexer_flags` with a same-slot sequence that changes balances and then syncs flags so an account or balance is considered closable while live exposure still exists, breaking `synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly` and causing `Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `sync_indexer_flags`
- Entrypoint: `sync_indexer_flags`
- Attacker controls: a same-slot sequence that changes balances and then syncs flags
- Exploit idea: Check whether closeability is computed from stale flags, stale counts, or partial balance scans rather than the full economic state. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact
- Fast validation: Force the controlled residual state and assert close attempts fail until every active balance and obligation is actually gone. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
