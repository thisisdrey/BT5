# Q5194: accrue-user-debts via deposit: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `deposit` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
