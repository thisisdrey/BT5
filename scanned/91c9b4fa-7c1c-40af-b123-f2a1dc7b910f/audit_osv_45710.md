# [M] Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: JLSEC-2026-241
Ecosystem: Julia
CVSS: 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
Published: 2026-04-27
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/JLSEC-2026-241
Type: osv

## Affected
- Julia: `OpenSSL_jll` — affected >=3.0.8+0 <3.0.10+0
- Julia: `Openresty_jll` — affected >=0 <1.27.1+0

## Details
Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions `DH_check()`, `DH_check_ex()`
or `EVP_PKEY_param_check()` to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long
delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained
from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.

The function `DH_check()` performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing
CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger
an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,
if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is
unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.

An application that calls `DH_check()` and supplies a key or parameters obtained
from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

The function `DH_check()` is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.
An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.
The other functions affected by this are `DH_check_ex()` and
`EVP_PKEY_param_check()`.

Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications
when using the "-check" option.

The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.

The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.
