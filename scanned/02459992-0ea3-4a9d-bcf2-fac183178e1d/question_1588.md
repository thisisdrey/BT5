# Q1588: debt-add-scaled via liquidate-multi: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
