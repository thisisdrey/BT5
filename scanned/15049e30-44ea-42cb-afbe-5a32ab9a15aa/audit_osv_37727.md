# [H] libsixel: Use-after-free in sixel_encoder_encode_bytes()

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-33021
Aliases: GHSA-j6m5-2cc7-3whc
CVSS: 7.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H)

Type: osv

## Details
libsixel is a SIXEL encoder/decoder implementation derived from kmiya's sixel. Versions 1.8.7 and prior contain a use-after-free vulnerability in sixel_encoder_encode_bytes() because sixel_frame_init() stores the caller-owned pixel buffer pointer directly in frame->pixels without making a defensive copy. When a resize operation is triggered, sixel_frame_convert_to_rgb888() unconditionally frees this caller-owned buffer and replaces it with a new internal allocation, leaving the caller with a dangling pointer. Any subsequent access to the original buffer by the caller constitutes a use-after-free, confirmed by AddressSanitizer. An attacker who controls incoming frames can trigger this bug repeatedly and predictably, resulting in a reliable crash with potential for code execution. This issue has been fixed in version 1.8.7-r1.
