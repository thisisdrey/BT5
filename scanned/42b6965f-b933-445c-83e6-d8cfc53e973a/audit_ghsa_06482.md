# [H] Socket.IO: Engine.IO Polling Transport Connection Exhaustion

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-r635-g3xr-vw7x
CVE: CVE-2026-59725
CWE: CWE-404
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-07-20
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r635-g3xr-vw7x
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- npm: `engine.io` — affected >=4.1.0 <6.6.7

## Details
### Impact

An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a denial of service in affected versions of **engine.io** by opening Engine.IO polling sessions and sending an invalid binary `POST` request with:

```
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
```


against an Engine.IO protocol v4 polling transport.

In the vulnerable code path, the server reports a transport error but does not properly close the HTTP response associated with the malformed request. As a result, the underlying HTTP connection may remain open, consuming one server-side socket/resource per crafted request.

An attacker can repeat this with many sessions to exhaust available HTTP connections, sockets, file descriptors, or related server resources, potentially preventing legitimate clients from connecting.

### Patches

The issue was fixed in:

- **engine.io `6.6.7`**

The fix ensures that invalid binary polling `POST` requests are explicitly rejected with an HTTP response and closed properly.

Users should upgrade to:

```sh
npm install engine.io@^6.6.7
```

or a later fixed version.

If using Socket.IO through the monorepo/packages, update to a Socket.IO release that depends on a fixed `engine.io` version.

### Workarounds

If upgrading immediately is not possible, possible mitigations include:

- Block or reject polling `POST` requests with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` for Engine.IO protocol v4 at a reverse proxy, load balancer, WAF, or application middleware.
- Disable HTTP long-polling if your deployment can use WebSocket-only transport.
- Enforce strict request/connection timeouts at the HTTP server, reverse proxy, or load balancer.
- Apply per-IP rate limits and connection limits for Engine.IO endpoints.
- Restrict access to the Socket.IO/Engine.IO endpoint where feasible.

Example Socket.IO configuration to disable polling, if compatible with your clients:

```js
const io = new Server(httpServer, {
  transports: ["websocket"],
});
```
