# Q5479: accrue-user-debts via redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `redeem` with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, then read `accrue-user-debts` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
