# Q3460: parse_vlan_link_info_from_linkinfo grows memory without an enforced bound (netlink.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `parse_vlan_link_info_from_linkinfo` in `xdp/src/netlink.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and grow the buffer `parse_vlan_link_info_from_linkinfo` feeds without any eviction bound taking effect, so that the invariant "Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `xdp/src/netlink.rs` -> `parse_vlan_link_info_from_linkinfo()` (around line 479)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Repeatedly drive `parse_vlan_link_info_from_linkinfo` so a buffer, map, or cache it feeds grows without eviction, exhausting node memory below the cost the attacker pays.
- Invariant to test: Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Stress the path and assert the container's size plateaus rather than growing linearly with attacker input.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply force sigverify, dedup, scheduling, or buffering work that vastly exceeds the fees ever collected, degrading the leader below true cost.
