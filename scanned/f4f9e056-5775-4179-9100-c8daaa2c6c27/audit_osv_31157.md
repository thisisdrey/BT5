In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix deadlock when freeing cgroup storage

The following commit
bc235cdb423a ("bpf: Prevent deadlock from recursive bpf_task_storage_[get|delete]")
first introduced deadlock prevention for fentry/fexit programs attaching
on bpf_task_storage helpers. That commit also employed the logic in map
free path in its v6 version.

Later bpf_cgrp_storage was first introduced in
c4bcfb38a95e ("bpf: Implement cgroup storage available to non-cgroup-attached bpf progs")
which faces the same issue as bpf_task_storage, instead of its busy
counter, NULL was passed to bpf_local_storage_map_free() which opened
a window to cause deadlock:

	</TASK>

Progs:
 - A: SEC("fentry/cgroup_storage_ptr")
   - cgid (BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH)
	Record the id of the cgroup the current task belonging
	to in this hash map, using the address of the cgroup
	as the map key.
   - cgrpa (BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGRP_STORAGE)
	If current task is a kworker, lookup the above hash
	map using function parameter @owner as the key to get
	its corresponding cgroup id which is then used to get
	a trusted pointer to the cgroup through
	bpf_cgroup_from_id(). This trusted pointer can then
	be passed to bpf_cgrp_storage_get() to finally trigger
	the deadlock issue.
 - B: SEC("tp_btf/sys_enter")
   - cgrpb (BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGRP_STORAGE)
	The only purpose of this prog is to fill Prog A's
	hash map by calling bpf_cgrp_storage_get() for as
	many userspace tasks as possible.

Steps to reproduce:
 - Run A;
 - while (true) { Run B; Destroy B; }

Fix this issue by passing its busy counter to the free procedure so
it can be properly incremented before storage/smap locking.
