# [M] Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern not followed

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Reporter: Zarf

## Details
# Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern not followed

## Summary

The `matchOrder()` and `buyPosition()` functions do not follow the checks-effects-interaction pattern which could result in:

- An order which is both cancelled and matched at the same time
- A sellorder which is both cancelled and bought at the same time

## Vulnerability Detail

In case the asset token is an ERC777 token masquerading as an ERC20 token, the order maker can perform a reentrancy attack to `cancelOrder()` when receiving the funds in the `matchOrder()` function. This will make the order both cancelled and matched at the same time.

Similarly, the sellOrder maker can perform a reentrancy attack to `cancelSellOrder()` when receiving the funds in the `buyPosition` function. This will make the sell order both cancelled and bought at the same time.

## Impact

Matched and bought orders still work as intended, even if they are cancelled. Therefore, this does not have an impact on the protocol itself. However, the user interface on the website might be tricked such that user will be unable to actually interact with the orders since they are shown as cancelled.
