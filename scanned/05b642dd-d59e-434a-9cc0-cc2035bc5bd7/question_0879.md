# Q0879: dispatch can desync code ownership or refcounts

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `dispatch` and make code ownership, refcounting, or removal eligibility differ across `extension checks`, `authorized origin`, and `charged weight`?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/meta-tx/src/lib.rs::dispatch
- Entrypoint: public dispatch wrapper `dispatch`
- Attacker controls: proof or signed payload contents, nested call payloads, batched or wrapped execution context
- Exploit idea: Search for paths where code references are created, reused, or removed across partial failure or repeated execution.
- Invariant to test: A code hash must have exactly the owners and live references recorded by storage.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized code/call execution or theft from contract-controlled funds
- Fast validation: Upload, instantiate, remove, and reuse the same code hash across multiple accounts and assert refcount accuracy under all failures.
