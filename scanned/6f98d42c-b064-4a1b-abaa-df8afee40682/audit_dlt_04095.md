# Pool can be drained

## Summary
The pool can be drained just as it was during the incident that occurred previously.
## Vulnerability Detail
`maxNotionalSwap` and `maxGamma` and the new math formula do not prevent the pool being drainable. Same attack vector that happent previously is still applicable:

Flashloan 99989999999999999990000 (99_990) WOO
Sell WOO partially (in 10 pieces) assuming maxGamma | maxNotionalSwap doesnt allow us to do it in one go
Sell 20 USDC and get 199779801821639475527975 (199_779) WOO
Repay flashloan, pocket the rest of the 100K WOO.
