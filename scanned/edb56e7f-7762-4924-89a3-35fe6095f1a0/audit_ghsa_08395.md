# [H] authentik's XML Signature Wrapping in SAML Source ACS allows authentication as arbitrary federated user

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-c3m2-jqmq-pvp3
CVE: CVE-2026-47201
CWE: CWE-20, CWE-287, CWE-347
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (CVSS_V3)

## Affected
- Go: `goauthentik.io` — affected >=0 <0.0.0-20260528144335-a370d76d23c7

## Details
### Summary
 
 authentik's SAML Source ACS endpoint is vulnerable to XML Signature Wrapping when validating upstream SAML responses. An attacker with any account at the upstream IdP can reuse a valid signed assertion to authenticate as another federated user.
 
 ### Patches
 
 authentik 2026.5.1, 2026.2.4 and 2025.12.6 fix this issue.
 
 ### Impact
 
 Affected: authentik deployments using a SAML Source for upstream SAML federation with signed assertions, or signed responses without signed assertions. Not affected: deployments that do not use SAML Source for upstream SAML federation.
 
 The SAML Source trusts that the verified XML signature belongs to the assertion or response that authentik later consumes. A crafted SAML response can make signature verification succeed against the attacker's original signed assertion while authentik reads identity data from a different forged assertion.
 
 An attacker first completes a legitimate login to the upstream IdP and captures the signed SAML response sent through their browser. They then submit a modified response to the ACS endpoint where the valid signature still verifies, but the consumed assertion contains a victim identifier or attacker-chosen attributes.
 
 The attacker can authenticate as a victim who has previously used the SAML Source, or as a local user matched by forged email or username when those matching modes are enabled.
 
 ### Workarounds
 
 Disable affected SAML Sources, or block access to their ACS endpoints.
