# Q2799: Vault NAV freshness and cross-contract state: cashflow withdrawal timing / cross-user wedge / one state one price

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower, investor, buyer, seller, or shareholder interacting through ordinary protocol entrypoints enter through `Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals` with ordinary investor-withdraw or cashflow-collection timing around a vault-held position while nav computation is idle and no batch is currently running and force a durable wedge where approvals, claims, or withdrawals use a snapshot that no longer matches what the vault actually owns or is owed, breaking the rule that the same real economic state should map to one consistent approval-time price regardless of user-controlled timing and leading to Cross-user exploit window created by ordinary borrower, buyer, or seller timing?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / _requireFreshNav, updateNav, collectCashflows, fundLoans, createSaleOffer, acceptSaleOffer
- Entrypoint: Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals
- Attacker controls: ordinary investor-withdraw or cashflow-collection timing around a vault-held position
- Exploit idea: force a durable wedge where approvals, claims, or withdrawals use a snapshot that no longer matches what the vault actually owns or is owed
- Invariant to test: the same real economic state should map to one consistent approval-time price regardless of user-controlled timing
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user exploit window created by ordinary borrower, buyer, or seller timing
- Fast validation: Fuzz ownershipNonce-changing actions around `_requireFreshNav` and ensure every priced approval sees the latest holdings epoch.
