# Q1602: Exchange offer lifecycle: seller inputs / stale snapshot / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline while every listed loan is locked to the exchange while the offer is live and make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline
- Exploit idea: make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
