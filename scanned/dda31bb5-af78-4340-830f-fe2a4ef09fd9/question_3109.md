# Q3109: Address-book role bit isolation: mutual whitelist / book bleed / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits while the same grantee address is intentionally present under multiple roles for legitimate reasons and make self-book updates affect canonical-book semantics or another address owner's semantics, breaking the rule that each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution after a wrong-role counterparty enters the lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits
- Exploit idea: make self-book updates affect canonical-book semantics or another address owner's semantics
- Invariant to test: each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution after a wrong-role counterparty enters the lifecycle
- Fast validation: Model one self-managed book plus the canonical book and assert they can never substitute for each other.
