# Q1668: filter-out-debt-asset via liquidate-multi: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `filter-out-debt-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
