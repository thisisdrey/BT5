## Details
# BatchMatchOrders Does Not Keep Track of `msg.value`, Putting Contract In Potentially Vulnerable State

## Summary
`batchMatchOrders()` does not keep track of the remaining `msg.value` while executing each `matchOrders()`. This causes any ether balance on the contract to be drainable as a user could call `batchMatchOrders()` with the same `msg.value`. The current implementations associated with any signs of `msg.value` in the contract though are associated with `WETH` deposits, so this only effects the futurability of the contract (because with normal use the ether balance of the contract will remain 0 - otherwise this would be considered high severity), and just leaves the contract to simple be in a "vulnerable state" with little to no funds to steal.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `matchOrders` function has the ability to use `WETH` as the order's asset, and thus accepts a `msg.value` with the transfer in order to be deposited to `WETH` and thus transferred to the contract.
`msg.value` always stays the same throughout execution, so lets say two orders were matched in the `batchMatchOrders()` with the same taker price, both could be filled by the price of one if the balance of the contract is sufficient.
In the case that the ether balance of the contract is insufficient for the `WETH` deposit, the transaction will revert. Even this is later than expected though, as the transaction should have reverted earlier.
## Impact
Any ether sent to the `BvbProtocol.sol` contract are in a vulnerable state and drainable, otherwise the contract reverts for an incorrect reason later than expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a variable in `batchMatchOrders()` to keep track of the remaining `msg.value` after each iteration of `matchOrders()`. This will more accurately depict what is left of the ether sent.
