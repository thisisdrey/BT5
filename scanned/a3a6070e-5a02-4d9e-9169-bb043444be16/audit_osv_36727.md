# [M] ESF-IDF Has Use-after-free Vulnerability in BLE Provisioning

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-25507
Aliases: GHSA-h7r3-gmg9-xjmg
CVSS: 6.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)

Type: osv

## Details
ESF-IDF is the Espressif Internet of Things (IOT) Development Framework. In versions 5.5.2, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, and 5.1.6, a use-after-free vulnerability was reported in the BLE provisioning transport (protocomm_ble) layer. The issue can be triggered by a remote BLE client while the device is in provisioning mode. The vulnerability occurred when provisioning was stopped with keep_ble_on = true. In this configuration, internal protocomm_ble state and GATT metadata were freed while the BLE stack and GATT services remained active. Subsequent BLE read or write callbacks dereferenced freed memory, allowing a connected or newly connected client to trigger invalid memory acces. This issue has been patched in versions 5.5.3, 5.4.4, 5.3.5, 5.2.7, and 5.1.7.
