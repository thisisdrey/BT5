# Q5872: filter-u128 via collateral-add: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order reach `filter-u128` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it filters a 128-entry bucket list, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97` -> `filter-u128`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
