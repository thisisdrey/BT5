# Q0111: tick_height is not deterministic across nodes (poh_recorder.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `tick_height` in `poh/src/poh_recorder.rs` with a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit, and make the transactions recorded into PoH for an entry disagree with the transactions committed to the bank for that entry, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `tick_height` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `poh/src/poh_recorder.rs` -> `tick_height()` (around line 768)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit
- Exploit idea: Find input to `tick_height` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `tick_height` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `tick_height` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
