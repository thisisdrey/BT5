# [M] Runtipi: Unauthenticated arbitrary file read through app-store logo symlinks

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-47277
Aliases: GHSA-qrqj-p7hm-4m66
CVSS: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Type: osv

## Details
Runtipi is a personal homeserver orchestrator. In versions 4.9.1 through 4.9.3, Runtipi serves marketplace app logos from files inside cloned app-store repositories through an unauthenticated endpoint, which leads to arbitrary file read through app-store logo symlinks. The path guard checks only the lexical path before Node reads the file, so a Git app store that contains metadata/logo.jpg as a symbolic link can cause Runtipi to read and return the symlink target. Because the endpoint is public and the symlink target may point outside the cloned repository, this can expose local files from the Runtipi container such as /data/.env, /data/state/seed, logs, or application files. This can disclose JWT secrets, service credentials, local configuration, and operational logs depending on the instance. The issue has been fixed in version 4.10.0.
