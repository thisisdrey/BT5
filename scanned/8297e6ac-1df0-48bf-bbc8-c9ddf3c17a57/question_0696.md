# Q0696: unpack-u16 via collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls call ordering within the block reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz call ordering within the block across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `unpack-u16` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
