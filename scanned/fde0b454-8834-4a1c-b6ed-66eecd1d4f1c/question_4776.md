# Q4776: iter-price-multi via collateral-remove: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) reach `iter-price-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405` -> `iter-price-multi`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `iter-price-multi` carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `iter-price-multi` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
