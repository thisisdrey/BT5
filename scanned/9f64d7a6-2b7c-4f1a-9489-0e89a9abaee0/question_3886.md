# Q3886: socialize-debt via liquidate: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `socialize-debt` writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`, so the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944` -> `socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt` writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`. Reach it through `liquidate` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
