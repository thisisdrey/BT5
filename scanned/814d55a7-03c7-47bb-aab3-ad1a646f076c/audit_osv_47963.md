# [C] CVE-2017-15597

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: CVE-2017-15597
CVSS: 9.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2017-10-30
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2017-15597
Type: osv

## Details
An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. Grant copying code made an implication that any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable page reference. Other portions of code, however, did not match up with that assumption. When such a grant copy operation is being done on a grant of a dying domain, the assumption turns out wrong. A malicious guest administrator can cause hypervisor memory corruption, most likely resulting in host crash and a Denial of Service. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.
