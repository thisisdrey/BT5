# Q3692: lib - AuthResolver resolution accepted for the wrong signer (8)

## Question
Given the request is replayed against a sibling subwallet deployment, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through an on-chain call that triggers nonce rotation or cleanup before a victim's request lands, make `add_pending` in `crates/signatures/nep641/src/lib.rs` return an `AuthorizationResolution` that authorises a `signer_id` other than the one the resolved access key or contract actually belongs to, breaking the invariant `the `signer_id` an `AuthorizationResolution` authorises == the account whose key was actually resolved` and leading to direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/signatures/nep641/src/lib.rs](crates/signatures/nep641/src/lib.rs) - `add_pending` (cross-check `is_leaf` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: an on-chain call that triggers nonce rotation or cleanup before a victim's request lands
- Attacker controls: the timing of the triggering call
- Exploit idea: NEP-641 resolution maps an account/key to an authorisation decision; probe caching, stale key sets, and default-allow branches. Set-up: the request is replayed against a sibling subwallet deployment.
- Invariant to test: the `signer_id` an `AuthorizationResolution` authorises == the account whose key was actually resolved
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation
- Fast validation: Resolve against a rotated/removed key; assert authorisation is refused.
