## Details
Details
A staff member who has permission to add, archive and unarchive development stores as shown in managedStoreA.png  can also add new managed stores. I can't tell if the issue I pointed out in #1167453 has the same root cause as this. A staff member with the said permission can access /organizationID/stores/create_managed_store endpoint as seen in managedStoreB.png. The POST request below can be used to reproduce the described issue.

```

```

## Impact

Staff member can perform action that requires permission
