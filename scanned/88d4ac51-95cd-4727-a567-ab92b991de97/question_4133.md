# Q4133: protocol-version gating at the epoch boundary — signable_message.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through `broadcast_tx_commit` / `send_tx` RPC carrying a SignedTransaction signed by an ordinary FullAccess key, a transaction only valid under the previous protocol version, timed at the first block of a new epoch, with the boundary value chosen exactly at the enforced limit, and additionally with the boundary value chosen one unit past the enforced limit, reach `new_off_chain` in `core/primitives/src/signable_message.rs` and have nodes disagree on whether the transaction is valid depending on the version they resolve, breaking the invariant that transaction validity is a deterministic function of the executing block's protocol version, leading to High - Unintended chain split (network partition)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/signable_message.rs` :: `new_off_chain`
- Entrypoint: `broadcast_tx_commit` / `send_tx` RPC carrying a SignedTransaction signed by an ordinary FullAccess key
- Attacker controls: a transaction only valid under the previous protocol version, timed at the first block of a new epoch; with the boundary value chosen exactly at the enforced limit; with the boundary value chosen one unit past the enforced limit
- Exploit idea: have nodes disagree on whether the transaction is valid depending on the version they resolve
- Invariant to test: transaction validity is a deterministic function of the executing block's protocol version
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Unintended chain split (network partition)
- Fast validation: test-loop test upgrading protocol version mid-run and replaying the transaction
