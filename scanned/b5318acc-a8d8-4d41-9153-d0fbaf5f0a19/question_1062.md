# Q1062: Investor withdrawal routing: ownership churn / double claim / single claim per payable

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts while a sale offer was recently accepted or cancelled before the batch executes and make one payable balance claimable in two ownership or lock epochs, breaking the rule that each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs and leading to Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts
- Exploit idea: make one payable balance claimable in two ownership or lock epochs
- Invariant to test: each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party
- Fast validation: Check that every withdrawable principal and interest balance can be claimed exactly once and never becomes unreachable after a normal epoch change.
