# Q2835: error - MPC tweak / derivation collision across wallets (5)

## Question
Given the request is replayed against a sibling subwallet deployment, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `w_execute_signed(msg: RequestMessage, proof: String)` - relayable by any account, find two distinct wallet identities whose derivation through `ResolveErrorKind` in `crates/signatures/nep641/src/resolver/error.rs` produces the same tweak or derived key, so one wallet can authorise actions for another, breaking the invariant `distinct (account, path) inputs produce distinct derived keys` and leading to direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/signatures/nep641/src/resolver/error.rs](crates/signatures/nep641/src/resolver/error.rs) - `ResolveErrorKind` (cross-check `ResolveError` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `w_execute_signed(msg: RequestMessage, proof: String)` - relayable by any account
- Attacker controls: the entire `RequestMessage` (chain_id, signer_id, nonce, deadline, ops) and the `proof` string
- Exploit idea: The derivation concatenates identifiers before hashing; unescaped separators or attacker-chosen path components create collisions. Set-up: the request is replayed against a sibling subwallet deployment.
- Invariant to test: distinct (account, path) inputs produce distinct derived keys
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation
- Fast validation: Property-test `ResolveErrorKind` for collisions with separator-bearing inputs.
