# Q5741: mod - re-entrancy through an attacker-named callee (35)

## Question
Given the receiver accepts the assets and then panics, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_on_transfer` / `nft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` from a token contract the attacker wrote, have the contract named in `msg` / `AuthCall::contract_id` / `NotifyOnTransfer` re-enter `execute_intents`, `ft_withdraw` or a `*_resolve_*` path while `STORAGE_DEPOSIT_GAS` in `contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/mod.rs` is mid-settlement, observing or mutating state between the debit and the credit, breaking the invariant `the balance changes committed by a receipt == the balance changes the signed intents authorise, whatever any callee does` and leading to direct theft of user funds: double settlement (assets delivered AND re-credited)?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/mod.rs](contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/mod.rs) - `STORAGE_DEPOSIT_GAS` (cross-check `MT_RESOLVE_DEPOSIT_PER_TOKEN_GAS` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_on_transfer` / `nft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` from a token contract the attacker wrote
- Attacker controls: `sender_id`, `amount`, the `msg` (receiver, notify, or nested intents), and the token's own behaviour
- Exploit idea: `Engine::finalize` has already run when the promise fires; the callee can spend the same balance again or take goods plus refund. Set-up: the receiver accepts the assets and then panics.
- Invariant to test: the balance changes committed by a receipt == the balance changes the signed intents authorise, whatever any callee does
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds: double settlement (assets delivered AND re-credited)
- Fast validation: Sandbox: deploy an `on_auth`/`mt_on_transfer` that calls back into `execute_intents`; assert no balance is spent twice.
