# Q1076: Investor withdrawal routing: ownership churn / wrong recipient / no stale unlocker

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts while a vault, exchange, or later counterparty relies on the same payable balances after the batch and make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans, breaking the rule that a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts
- Exploit idea: make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans
- Invariant to test: a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale
- Fast validation: Check that every withdrawable principal and interest balance can be claimed exactly once and never becomes unreachable after a normal epoch change.
