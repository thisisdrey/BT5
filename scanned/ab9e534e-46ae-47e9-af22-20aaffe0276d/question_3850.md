# Q3850: subset via supply-collateral-add: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, can an unprivileged attacker make `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `subset` tests bitmask containment, so the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
