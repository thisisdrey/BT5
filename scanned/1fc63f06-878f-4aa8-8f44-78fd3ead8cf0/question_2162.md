# Q2162: Vault async deposit flow: partial claim / ratio drift / pending sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with alternating deposit() and mint() claims against the same claimable position while a holdings or ledger change zeroes `lastNavUpdate` between request and the next approval cycle and make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers and leading to Cross-shareholder dilution through broken async deposit accounting?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: alternating deposit() and mint() claims against the same claimable position
- Exploit idea: make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-shareholder dilution through broken async deposit accounting
- Fast validation: Inject an approval after a NAV invalidation cycle and assert the final claim never exceeds the exact approval-time price lock.
