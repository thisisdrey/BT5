# [H] Improper Authentication in Atlassian Connect Spring Boot

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-2x7v-w2mv-f3rx
CVE: CVE-2021-26077
CWE: CWE-287
Ecosystem: Maven
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2021-06-16
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2x7v-w2mv-f3rx
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Maven: `com.atlassian.connect:atlassian-connect-spring-boot` — affected >=1.1.0 <2.1.3
- Maven: `com.atlassian.connect:atlassian-connect-spring-boot` — affected >=2.1.4 <2.1.5

## Details
Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Spring Boot (ACSB) in version 1.1.0 before 2.1.3 and from version 2.1.4 before 2.1.5: Atlassian Connect Spring Boot is a Java Spring Boot package for building Atlassian Connect apps. Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian Connect Spring Boot app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Spring Boot versions 1.1.0 before 2.1.3 and versions 2.1.4 before 2.1.5 erroneously accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints (such as installation) where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated re-installation events to an app.
