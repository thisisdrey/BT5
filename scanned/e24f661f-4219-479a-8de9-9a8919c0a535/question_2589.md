# Q2589: relevant via collateral-remove-redeem: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, drive `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) — which drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask — to convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction, breaking the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `relevant` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
