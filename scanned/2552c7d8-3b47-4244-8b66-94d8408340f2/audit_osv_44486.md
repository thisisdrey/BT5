# [M] Unbounded HTTP/1 status-line and chunk-extension buffering in Mint causes memory-exhaustion DoS

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-82728
Aliases: EEF-CVE-2026-82728, GHSA-g83f-2j6r-q6m4
CVSS: 6.0 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)

Type: osv

## Details
Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in elixir-mint mint allows a remote HTTP server to exhaust memory on the client host and cause a denial of service.

Two HTTP/1 response-parser states accumulate server data without any cap. In lib/mint/http1.ex, decode_status_line/4 stores the unconsumed data in conn.buffer when the status line is incomplete, and decode_body/5 does the same for an unterminated chunk-extension line. Both wait for a CRLF the server never has to send, and conn.buffer is prepended to every subsequent socket message. The :max_header_list_size budget is wired only into decode_headers/5 and decode_trailer_headers/4, so neither of these states is covered by it. A malicious server, or one reached through an attacker-controlled redirect or a fetched URL, streams bytes indefinitely until the BEAM node is killed by the operating system out-of-memory handler. The chunk-extension variant is reached after a valid status line and a complete, valid header section, so an intermediary inspecting only headers sees an ordinary 200 response.

This issue affects mint: from 0.1.0 before 1.10.0.
