# Q1687: Exchange offer lifecycle: accept timing / lock residue / full unlock on cancel

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer-controlled acceptance timing near expiry or around other state changes while the deadline is close enough that ordering and timestamp boundaries matter and make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone, breaking the rule that cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer-controlled acceptance timing near expiry or around other state changes
- Exploit idea: make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone
- Invariant to test: cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement
- Fast validation: Simulate cancel/relist cycles and ensure no listed loan remains locked or economically bound to a dead offer.
