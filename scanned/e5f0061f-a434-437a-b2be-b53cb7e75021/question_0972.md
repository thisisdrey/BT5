# Q0972: DelegateAction replay after relayer submission — mod.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `DelegateAction` (NEP-366 meta-transaction) handed to any public relayer, one signed DelegateAction plus a max_block_height far in the future, resubmitted by several relayers, with the boundary value chosen exactly at the enforced limit, reach `get_prepaid_gas` in `core/primitives/src/action/mod.rs` and have the same signed delegate payload executed more than once against the signer account, breaking the invariant that a signed DelegateAction executes at most once regardless of how many relayers submit it, leading to High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/action/mod.rs` :: `get_prepaid_gas`
- Entrypoint: a `DelegateAction` (NEP-366 meta-transaction) handed to any public relayer
- Attacker controls: one signed DelegateAction plus a max_block_height far in the future, resubmitted by several relayers; with the boundary value chosen exactly at the enforced limit
- Exploit idea: have the same signed delegate payload executed more than once against the signer account
- Invariant to test: a signed DelegateAction executes at most once regardless of how many relayers submit it
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass
- Fast validation: runtime test submitting the identical SignedDelegateAction twice and asserting the second fails
