# Q1019: Investor withdrawal routing: duplicate ids / batch bleed / batch isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with duplicate, reordered, or adversarially mixed loan ids in the batch while a vault, exchange, or later counterparty relies on the same payable balances after the batch and make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it, breaking the rule that batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: duplicate, reordered, or adversarially mixed loan ids in the batch
- Exploit idea: make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it
- Invariant to test: batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale
- Fast validation: Check that every withdrawable principal and interest balance can be claimed exactly once and never becomes unreachable after a normal epoch change.
