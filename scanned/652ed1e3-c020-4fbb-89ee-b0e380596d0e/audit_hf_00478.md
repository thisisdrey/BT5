## Details
In the OracleLess contract, the createOrder() function does not verify whether the tokenIn is a legitimate ERC20 token, allowing attackers to create an order with a malicious token. Additionally, the fillOrder() function does not check if the target and txData are valid, enabling attackers to execute their order with a malicious target and txData.
The OracleLess.createOrder() function does not verify whether tokenIn is a legitimate ERC20 token.
Additionally, the OracleLess.fillOrder() function does not check if target and txData are valid.

Attack Path
Let's consider the following scenario:
1. Alice, the attacker, creates a malicious token.
2. Alice creates an order with her malicious token:
• tokenIn: Alice's malicious token
• tokenOut: WETH
• minAmountOut: 0
3. Alice calls the fillOrder() function to execute her malicious order, setting parameters as follows:
• target: address of USDT
• txData: transfer all USDT in the OracleLess contract to Alice.
function fillOrder(
...
(uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) = execute(
    target,
    txData,
    order
);
...
}
• At line 118 of the fillOrder() function, execute() is invoked:
```solidity
function execute(
    address target,
    bytes calldata txData,
    Order memory order
) internal returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 tokenInRefund) {
    //update accounting
    uint256 initialTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 initialTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));
    //approve
    order.tokenIn.safeApprove(target, order.amountIn);
    //perform the call
    (bool success, bytes memory reason) = target.call(txData);
    if (!success) {
        revert TransactionFailed(reason);
    }
    uint256 finalTokenIn = order.tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(finalTokenIn >= initialTokenIn - order.amountIn, "over spend");
    uint256 finalTokenOut = order.tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(
        finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut > order.minAmountOut,
        "Too Little Received"
    );
    amountOut = finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut;
    tokenInRefund = order.amountIn - (initialTokenIn - finalTokenIn);
}
```
– At line 237 of the execute() function, tokenIn.safeApprove() is called.
Alice made her malicious tokenIn as follows:
```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {
    WETH.transfer(msg.sender, 1);
    return true;
}
```
This transfers 1 wei of WETH to the OracleLess contract.
– At line 240, all USDT are transferred to Alice, as target is USDT and txData is set to transfer to Alice.
– At line 251, finalTokenOut - initialTokenOut will be 1, as the contract has already received 1 wei. Thus, the require statement will pass since order.minAmountOut was set 0.
As a result, Alice can drain all USDT from the OracleLess contract.
Attackers can drain the OracleLess contract by using malicious token, target, and txData.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement a whitelist mechanism for token, target, and txData.
