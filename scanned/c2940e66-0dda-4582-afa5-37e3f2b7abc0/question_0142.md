# Q0142: transaction selection versus chunk gas limit — event_type.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a burst of independently signed transactions submitted across many attacker accounts in one block, many transactions whose declared gas is small but whose conversion cost is large, when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit, reach `children_shards` in `chain/chain/src/resharding/event_type.rs` and have a chunk accept a transaction set whose conversion alone exceeds the chunk gas limit, breaking the invariant that the selected transaction set fits the chunk gas limit including conversion cost, leading to High - Temporary freezing of network transactions (chunk/block production delayed 500%+ over recent average)?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/chain/src/resharding/event_type.rs` :: `children_shards`
- Entrypoint: a burst of independently signed transactions submitted across many attacker accounts in one block
- Attacker controls: many transactions whose declared gas is small but whose conversion cost is large; when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit
- Exploit idea: have a chunk accept a transaction set whose conversion alone exceeds the chunk gas limit
- Invariant to test: the selected transaction set fits the chunk gas limit including conversion cost
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of network transactions (chunk/block production delayed 500%+ over recent average)
- Fast validation: test-loop test measuring chunk apply time for the crafted transaction set
