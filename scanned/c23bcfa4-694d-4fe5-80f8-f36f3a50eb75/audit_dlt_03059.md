# Vulnerability details

### Impact

The pricing of a YieldBox token for AAVE is done in the following way:

Which uses the balance in the strategy over the shares minted

https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/f5ad271b2dcab8b643b7cf622c2d6a128e109999/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L130-L137

```solidity
        uint256 totalAmount = _tokenBalanceOf(asset);
        if (share == 0) {
            // value of the share may be lower than the amount due to rounding, that's ok
            share = amount._toShares(totalSupply[assetId], totalAmount, false);
        } else {
            // amount may be lower than the value of share due to rounding, in that case, add 1 to amount (Always round up)
            amount = share._toAmount(totalSupply[assetId], totalAmount, true);
        }
```

The balance is computed by querying a view function in the strategy `currentBalance`
https://github.com/Tapioca-DAO/YieldBox/blob/f5ad271b2dcab8b643b7cf622c2d6a128e109999/contracts/YieldBox.sol#L102-L104

```solidity
    /// @dev Returns the total balance of `token` the strategy contract holds,
    /// plus the total amount this contract thinks the strategy holds.
    function _tokenBalanceOf(Asset storage asset) internal view returns (uint256 amount) {
        return asset.strategy.currentBalance();
    }
```
