# Q3180: Address-book role bit isolation: canonical adjacency / whitelist bypass / exact whitelist

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with self-book actions performed near canonical-book admin changes but without any privileged access while the same grantee address is intentionally present under multiple roles for legitimate reasons and make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present, breaking the rule that loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book and leading to Loans NFT or cashflow rights entering an unauthorized counterparty context?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: self-book actions performed near canonical-book admin changes but without any privileged access
- Exploit idea: make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present
- Invariant to test: loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT or cashflow rights entering an unauthorized counterparty context
- Fast validation: Fuzz register/unregister churn across roles and ensure no stale authorization survives in create or exchange flows.
