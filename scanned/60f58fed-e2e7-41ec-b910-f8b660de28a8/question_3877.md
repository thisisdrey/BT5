# Q3877: Smart account deployment and initialization: init arrays / address confusion / one-shot configure

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer while other users or systems rely on the predicted address before the account is actually deployed and make predicted-address semantics diverge from the actual deployed account or from who effectively controls it, breaking the rule that `configureSmartAccount` should run at most once and only in the intended delegatecall context of a fresh Safe and leading to Cross-user confusion about who controls a newly deployed operational account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer
- Exploit idea: make predicted-address semantics diverge from the actual deployed account or from who effectively controls it
- Invariant to test: `configureSmartAccount` should run at most once and only in the intended delegatecall context of a fresh Safe
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user confusion about who controls a newly deployed operational account
- Fast validation: Fuzz initializer arrays and duplicate entries, then assert the resulting Safe has exactly the declared owners, threshold, delegates, and routes.
