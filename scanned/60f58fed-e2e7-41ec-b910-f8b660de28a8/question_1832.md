# Q1832: Exchange offer lifecycle: address-book churn / lock residue / exact counterparties

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance while the offer contains multiple loans whose economic state can diverge while storage stays static and make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone, breaking the rule that mutual investor-registration checks should bind the exact buyer and seller that receive settlement value and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance
- Exploit idea: make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone
- Invariant to test: mutual investor-registration checks should bind the exact buyer and seller that receive settlement value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
