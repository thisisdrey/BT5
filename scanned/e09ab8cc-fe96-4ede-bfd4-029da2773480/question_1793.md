# Q1793: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via supply-collateral-add: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, drive `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) — which reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
