# Q1851: calc-index-next via collateral-remove: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
`calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) applies a multiplier to the current index. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), use that to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-index-next` touches, run `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
