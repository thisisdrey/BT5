# Q1211: Investor withdrawal routing: mixed balances / batch bleed / batch isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value while a vault, exchange, or later counterparty relies on the same payable balances after the batch and make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it, breaking the rule that batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value
- Exploit idea: make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it
- Invariant to test: batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers
- Fast validation: Forge test mixed locked/unlocked batches, duplicate ids, and ownership transfers, then assert each loan pays exactly one valid recipient once.
