# Q0106: Loans create authorization: originator mismatch / role confusion / caller binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with a fake `originator` parameter that names another address while the attacker remains `msg.sender` while the target counterparty addresses are registered and unregistered across attacker-controlled books in nearby transactions and reuse one role approval context to satisfy a different role check and initialize a loan with unauthorized parties, breaking the rule that the `originator` parameter and the effective caller identity should never diverge for an unprivileged transaction and leading to Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: a fake `originator` parameter that names another address while the attacker remains `msg.sender`
- Exploit idea: reuse one role approval context to satisfy a different role check and initialize a loan with unauthorized parties
- Invariant to test: the `originator` parameter and the effective caller identity should never diverge for an unprivileged transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user
- Fast validation: Build a minimal scenario where a toxic loan would later be fundable or priceable, and assert the creation step itself cannot be reached by an unprivileged caller.
