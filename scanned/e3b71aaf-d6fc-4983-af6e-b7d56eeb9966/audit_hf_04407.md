## Details
There is a problem that anyone can increase another handler contract nonce (`nonce_manager`) in settlement contract.

`nonce_manager` is used to make `txid`

                {
                    // Increment nonce for the sender
                    nonce_manager[msg.sender] += 1;
                }
    
                uint256 txid = uint256(
                    keccak256(
                        abi.encodePacked(
                            chain,
                            to_chain,
                            msg.sender, // from address for settlement to calculate txid
                            address(this), //  from handler for settlement to calculate txid
                            to_handler,
                            nonce_manager[msg.sender]
                        )
                    )
                );

`txid` is generated using several arguments and the `nonce_manager[msg.sender]` value as shown above.

                emit CrossChainLocked(
                    txid,
                    msg.sender,
                    to,
                    chain,
                    to_chain,
                    address(this),
                    to_token,
                    amount,
                    mode
                );

The handler function emits the corresponding `txid` value as an event.

        ///Handler code
                    // Send the cross chain msg
                    settlement.send_cross_chain_msg(
                        to_chain,
                        msg.sender,
                        to_handler,
                        PayloadType.ERC20,
                        cross_chain_msg_bytes
                    );

    ///Settlement code
            nonce_manager[from_address] += 1;
    
            address from_handler = msg.sender;
    
            uint256 txid = uint256(
                keccak256(
                    abi.encodePacked(
                        contract_chain_name, // from chain
                        to_chain,
                        from_address, // msg.sender address
                        from_handler, // settlement handler address
                        to_handler,
                        nonce_manager[from_address]
                    )
                )
            );
    
            emit CrossChainMsg(
                txid,
                from_address,
                contract_chain_name,
                to_chain,
                from_handler,
                to_handler,
                payload_type,
                payload
            );

Before the event emit, the handler function calls `settlement.send_cross_chain_msg`. The `send_cross_chain_msg` function of settlement also creates a `txid` and emits an event using this `txid`.

Through this process, the handler contract and the settlement contract emit the same `txid` event.

The system processes this emitted `txid` to handle the task.

However, there is a vulnerability that allows anyone to manipulate the `nonce_manager` value used when generating `txid` in the settlement contract with someone else’s `nonce_manager` value, which can cause confusion in the system.

## Proof of Concept
```solidity
uint256 txid = uint256(
                    keccak256(
                        abi.encodePacked(
                            chain,
                            to_chain,
                            msg.sender, // from address for settlement to calculate txid
                            address(this), //  from handler for settlement to calculate txid
                            to_handler,
                            nonce_manager[msg.sender]
                        )
                    )
                );
```

                    // Send the cross chain msg
                    settlement.send_cross_chain_msg(
                        to_chain,
                        msg.sender,
                        to_handler,
                        PayloadType.ERC20,
                        cross_chain_msg_bytes
                    );

When the `cross_chain_erc20_settlement` function is called in the handler contract, a `txid` is generated and the `send_cross_chain_msg` function of the settlement contract is called.
    
            function send_cross_chain_msg(
                string memory to_chain,
                address from_address,
                uint256 to_handler,
                PayloadType payload_type,
                bytes calldata payload
            ) external {
                nonce_manager[from_address] += 1;
    
                address from_handler = msg.sender;
    
                uint256 txid = uint256(
                    keccak256(
                        abi.encodePacked(
                            contract_chain_name, // from chain
                            to_chain,
                            from_address, // msg.sender address
                            from_handler, // settlement handler address
                            to_handler,
                            nonce_manager[from_address]
                        )
                    )
                );

In the `send_cross_chain_msg` function of the settlement contract, the `from_address` argument is set to the address of the user who called the `cross_chain_erc20_settlement` function of the handler set in the handler, the nonce value of the address is increased, and a `txid` is generated.

Here, the `send_cross_chain_msg` function is defined as external, so it is a function that can be called by outsiders, and since there is no other access control when increasing the nonce of `from_address` in `nonce_manager`, anyone can increase the nonce of a specific user’s settlement contract.

This can cause an imbalance between the handler’s nonce and the settlement’s nonce, potentially causing system confusion.

Also, if the same user of another handler calls the `cross_chain_erc20_settlement` function, a mismatch between the user nonce of the handler and the settlement will occur.

Write test code in `ChakraSettlementHandler.ts` file

This test code tests whether the sender’s (user’s) nonce value has been manipulated by the Attacker.

## Recommendation
Set the nonce value in the settlement contract to be managed by `from_handler`

Modify `nonce_manager` as in the code above so that the user’s `nonce_manager` can increase according to the handler.

This operation prevents an attacker from manipulating someone else’s nonce by pretending to be a handler, and also prevents nonce collisions between other normal handlers.

The issue class of this submission concerns inconsistencies with regard to the nonce values utilized by the Chakra bridge.
This submission details how it can be maliciously sabotaged, and the remaining submissions detail how the nonces can naturally deviate. I believe that these issues are identical in nature and consider all to merit a high severity rating.
