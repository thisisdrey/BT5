# [H] KVM: SVM: Skip fastpath emulation on VM-Exit if next RIP isn't valid

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2025-40038
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2025-10-28
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2025-40038
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=6.5.0 <6.6.113, >=6.7.0 <6.12.53, >=6.13.0 <6.17.3

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: Skip fastpath emulation on VM-Exit if next RIP isn't valid

Skip the WRMSR and HLT fastpaths in SVM's VM-Exit handler if the next RIP
isn't valid, e.g. because KVM is running with nrips=false.  SVM must
decode and emulate to skip the instruction if the CPU doesn't provide the
next RIP, and getting the instruction bytes to decode requires reading
guest memory.  Reading guest memory through the emulator can fault, i.e.
can sleep, which is disallowed since the fastpath handlers run with IRQs
disabled.

Note, this is essentially a reapply of commit 5c30e8101e8d ("KVM: SVM:
Skip WRMSR fastpath on VM-Exit if next RIP isn't valid"), but with
different justification (KVM now grabs SRCU when skipping the instruction
for other reasons).
