## Details
## Summary

Sandboxed agents could escape exec routing via host=node override.

## Affected Packages / Versions

- Package: `openclaw`
- Ecosystem: npm
- Affected versions: `>= 2026.4.5 < 2026.4.10`

## Impact

A sandboxed agent could request `host: "node"` and route exec to a remote node instead of the intended sandbox execution path, bypassing the sandbox routing boundary.

## Technical Details

The fix blocks sandboxed exec escape to remote node targets and keeps routing aligned with the active sandbox policy.

## Fix

The issue was fixed in #63880. The first stable tag containing the fix is `v2026.4.10`, and `openclaw@2026.4.14` includes the fix.

## Release Process Note

Users should upgrade to `openclaw` 2026.4.10 or newer. The latest npm release, `2026.4.14`, already includes the fix.
