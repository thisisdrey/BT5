# [H] Wazuh: Unauthenticated Path Traversal in authd via Agent Group Name

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-39359
Aliases: GHSA-6q95-fcwc-4h44
CVSS: 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Type: osv

## Details
Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. In versions 4.0.0 through 4.10.3 and 4.11.0 through 4.14.4, a logic flaw affects the Wazuh Manager's enrollment daemon (authd) and synchronization daemon (remoted). The authd process allows agents to select a group during enrollment but does not filter path traversal sequences such as "..." While the manager checks for the group directory using wopendir(), the ".." sequence references the parent directory (/var/ossec/etc), allowing it to pass validation. After the malicious group is accepted and stored in the manager's global database, the remoted process uses this unchecked value to build paths for agent configuration synchronization. As a result, sensitive files from /var/ossec/etc, such as client.keys, ossec.conf, and internal certificates, are included in the agent's shared configuration stream and exposed to the attacker. This issue has been fixed in versions 4.10.4 and 4.14.5.
