# Q5675: auth_call - wNEAR debited but NEAR never delivered (12)

## Question
Given the named receiver account does not exist on chain, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through a `FtWithdraw` / `MtWithdraw` / `NftWithdraw` / `NativeWithdraw` / `StorageDeposit` / `AuthCall` intent inside `execute_intents`, make the `near_withdraw` unwrap or the follow-on call reached from `DO_AUTH_CALL_MIN_GAS` in `contracts/defuse/src/contract/intents/auth_call.rs` fail after the signer's wNEAR was already subtracted, with no refund path, breaking the invariant `wNEAR debited from an account == NEAR that reached the named receiver, or was returned to that account` and leading to permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/src/contract/intents/auth_call.rs](contracts/defuse/src/contract/intents/auth_call.rs) - `DO_AUTH_CALL_MIN_GAS` (cross-check `STATE_INIT_GAS` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: a `FtWithdraw` / `MtWithdraw` / `NftWithdraw` / `NativeWithdraw` / `StorageDeposit` / `AuthCall` intent inside `execute_intents`
- Attacker controls: every field of the withdrawal intent, including `msg`, `min_gas`, `state_init` and `attached_deposit`
- Exploit idea: `native_withdraw`, `storage_deposit`, deposit-bearing `auth_call` and `FtWithdraw::storage_deposit` all debit first and document that wNEAR is not refunded on failure. Set-up: the named receiver account does not exist on chain.
- Invariant to test: wNEAR debited from an account == NEAR that reached the named receiver, or was returned to that account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)
- Fast validation: Point the receiver at a non-existent or reverting account; assert whether the wNEAR is recoverable.
