# Q1293: interest-rate via liquidate-multi: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), drive `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) — which interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `interest-rate` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
