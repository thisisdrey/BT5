# Q2425: enumeration - NFT single-ownership invariant broken by a re-deposit (8)

## Question
Given the receiver accepts the assets and then panics, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `mt_transfer_call` / `mt_batch_transfer_call` to a receiver contract the attacker deployed, exploit the `total_supply > 1` NFT guard around `mt_tokens_for_owner` in `contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/nep245/enumeration.rs` so the same `Nep171TokenId` is credited twice, or so a legitimate re-deposit after a refund is permanently rejected, breaking the invariant ``total_supplies` for a `Nep171TokenId` is 0 or 1 at every observable point` and leading to unauthorized minting / balance inflation: a balance is credited with no matching asset received?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/nep245/enumeration.rs](contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/nep245/enumeration.rs) - `mt_tokens_for_owner` (cross-check `mt_tokens` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `mt_transfer_call` / `mt_batch_transfer_call` to a receiver contract the attacker deployed
- Attacker controls: `receiver_id`, `token_ids`, `amounts`, `memo`, `msg`, and the receiver's return value
- Exploit idea: The guard is checked after `total_supplies.add`; probe the refund/burn path restoring supply and any ordering where supply is not decremented. Set-up: the receiver accepts the assets and then panics.
- Invariant to test: `total_supplies` for a `Nep171TokenId` is 0 or 1 at every observable point
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unauthorized minting / balance inflation: a balance is credited with no matching asset received
- Fast validation: Deposit, withdraw with a failing transfer, and re-deposit the same NFT; assert supply never exceeds 1 and re-deposit succeeds.
