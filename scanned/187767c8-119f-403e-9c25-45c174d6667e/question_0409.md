# Q0409: Loans funding and disbursement state: fresh owner / phase skip / single funding

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a loan NFT that the attacker just acquired through a normal transfer or exchange settlement while status-like fields or off-chain expectations changed nearby but the economic balances still define the real state and make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable, breaking the rule that `fund` should only succeed once per loan and only for the current NFT owner of that same loan and leading to Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a loan NFT that the attacker just acquired through a normal transfer or exchange settlement
- Exploit idea: make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable
- Invariant to test: `fund` should only succeed once per loan and only for the current NFT owner of that same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC
- Fast validation: Fuzz commitment-sized amounts and lifecycle orderings, then assert funding and disbursement preserve the exact same commitment ledger.
