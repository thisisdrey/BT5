# Q5154: socialize-debt via liquidate-multi: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `socialize-debt` writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944` -> `socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt` writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `socialize-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
