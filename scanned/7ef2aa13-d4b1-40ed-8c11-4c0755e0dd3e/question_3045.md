# Q3045: is-healthy-with-mask via collateral-add: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling call ordering within the block, drive `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) — which resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW — to make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist, breaking the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `is-healthy-with-mask` touches, run `collateral-add` with call ordering within the block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
