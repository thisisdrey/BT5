# [H] Better Auth's rou3 Dependency has Double-Slash Path Normalization which can Bypass disabledPaths Config and Rate Limits

## Summary

## Affected
- npm: `better-auth` — affected >=0 <1.4.5

## Details
## Summary

An issue in the underlying router library **rou3** can cause `/path` and `//path` to be treated as identical routes. If your environment does **not** normalize incoming URLs (e.g., by collapsing multiple slashes), this can allow bypasses of `disabledPaths` and path-based rate limits.

## Details

Better Auth uses **better-call**, which internally relies on **rou3** for routing. Affected versions of rou3 normalize paths by removing empty segments. As a result:

* `/sign-in/email`
* `//sign-in/email`
* `///sign-in/email`

…all resolve to the same route.

Some production setups *automatically* collapse multiple slashes. This includes:

* Vercel with Nextjs (default)
* Cloudflare - when normalize to urls origin is enabled (https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/normalization/settings/#normalize-urls-to-origin)

In these environments and other configurations where `//path` reach Better Auth as `/path`, the issue does not apply.

## Fix

Updating rou3 to the latest version resolves the issue:

* better-call previously depended on `"rou3": "^0.5.1"`
* The fix was introduced after that version
  (commit: [https://github.com/h3js/rou3/commit/f60b43fa648399534507c9ac7db36d705b8874c3](https://github.com/h3js/rou3/commit/f60b43fa648399534507c9ac7db36d705b8874c3))

Better Auth recommends:

1. **Upgrading to Better Auth v1.4.5 or later**, which includes the updated rou3.
2. Ensuring the proxy normalizes URLs.
3. If project maintainers cannot upgrade yet, they can protect their app by normalizing url before it reaches better-auth handler. See example below:
```ts
const req = new Request(...) // this would be the actual request object
const url = new URL(req.url);
const normalizedPath = url.pathname.replace(/\/+/g, "/");

if (url.pathname !== normalizedPath) {
  url.pathname = normalizedPath;
  // Update the raw request pathname
  Object.defineProperty(req, "url", {
    value: url.toString(),
    writable: true,
    configurable: true,
  });
}
```

## Impact

* Bypass `disabledPaths`
* Bypass path-based rate limits

The impact of bypassing disabled paths could vary based on a project's configuration.
