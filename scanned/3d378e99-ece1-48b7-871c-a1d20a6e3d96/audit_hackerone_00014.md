## Details
**Repository:** [`monero-project/monero`](https://github.com/monero-project/monero) — `src/wallet/wallet_rpc_server.cpp` (shared vulnerable code also reached via `contrib/epee/src/net_ssl.cpp`). Affected branches: `master` (commit `230de3794`), `release-v0.18`, `release-v0.17` (and every release since the RPC was introduced in commit `67aa4adcf`, March 2019).

## Summary

The `set_daemon` JSON-RPC in `monero-wallet-rpc` accepts an `ssl_allowed_fingerprints` array and is supposed to pin the daemon's TLS cert to the listed SHA-256 digests. The handler never hex-decodes those strings — it just copies each character into the fingerprint buffer as a byte. A normal 64-char hex fingerprint ends up stored as 64 bytes of ASCII instead of 32 bytes of raw digest. `has_fingerprint()` later compares the real 32-byte SHA-256 of the peer cert against those 64-byte blobs with `std::binary_search`, so the check can never succeed. Because the command's default `ssl_support` is `"autodetect"`, the verify callback turns "nothing matched" into a `MWARNING` and accepts the connection anyway. Pinning is silently discarded.

The sibling CLI flag `--daemon-ssl-allowed-fingerprints` on the exact same binary goes through `epee::from_hex_locale::to_vector` and enforces `SSL_FINGERPRINT_SIZE == 32`. So the two paths accept the same documented input format and produce opposite security outcomes.

Buggy block, `src/wallet/wallet_rpc_server.cpp` (current master `230de3794`):

```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<uint8_t>> ssl_allowed_fingerprints;
ssl_allowed_fingerprints.reserve(req.ssl_allowed_fingerprints.size());
for (const std::string &fp: req.ssl_allowed_fingerprints)
{
  ssl_allowed_fingerprints.push_back({});
  std::vector<uint8_t> &v = ssl_allowed_fingerprints.back();
  for (auto c: fp)
    v.push_back(c);
}
```

Correct block, `src/wallet/wallet2.cpp` (CLI startup):

```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<uint8_t>> ssl_allowed_fingerprints{ daemon_ssl_allowed_fingerprints.size() };
std::transform(daemon_ssl_allowed_fingerprints.begin(), daemon_ssl_allowed_fingerprints.end(),
               ssl_allowed_fingerprints.begin(), epee::from_hex_locale::to_vector);
for (const auto &fpr: ssl_allowed_fingerprints)
{
  THROW_WALLET_EXCEPTION_IF(fpr.size() != SSL_FINGERPRINT_SIZE, tools::error::wallet_internal_error,
      "SHA-256 fingerprint should be " BOOST_PP_STRINGIZE(SSL_FINGERPRINT_SIZE) " bytes long.");
}
```

The decisive check in `contrib/epee/src/net_ssl.cpp`:

```cpp
if (!verified && !has_fingerprint(ctx))
{
  if (support != ssl_support_t::e_ssl_support_autodetect)
  {
    MERROR("SSL certificate is not in the allowed list, connection dropped");
    return false;
  }
  MWARNING("SSL peer has not been verified");
}
return true;
```

With `autodetect` (the command's default in `wallet_rpc_server_commands_defs.h`: `KV_SERIALIZE_OPT(ssl_support, (std::string)"autodetect")`) the branch falls through to `return true` and the daemon's cert is accepted.

## Releases Affected

Every release since the `set_daemon` RPC was added in commit `67aa4adcf` (March 2019) — i.e. `v0.14.x` through `v0.18.x` and current `master @ 230de3794`. I checked `release-v0.17` and `release-v0.18` branches directly; the ASCII-copy block is byte-identical to master. The Ubuntu 22.04 `monero` package (`0.17.2.0`) also reproduces.

## Steps to Reproduce

I packaged the whole thing as a self-contained script (no `sudo` needed on Ubuntu 22.04, it uses `apt-get download` + `dpkg-deb -x` into `/tmp`):

```
./poc_set_daemon_pinning_bypass.sh
```

Run it with `bash ./poc_set_daemon_pinning_bypass.sh`.

What it does, briefly:

1. Pulls `monerod` and `monero-wallet-rpc` from the Ubuntu `monero` .deb into `/tmp/monero_extract`.
2. Generates two distinct self-signed certs, `real.crt` (fingerprint `$FP_REAL`) and `evil.crt` (fingerprint `$FP_EVIL`).
3. Starts two regtest daemons: real on `127.0.0.1:48080` with `real.crt`, evil on `127.0.0.1:49080` with `evil.crt`. Both in `--offline` mode so they cannot talk to each other.
4. Starts `monero-wallet-rpc`, creates a fresh wallet, and mines 5 blocks on the **evil** daemon only. Direct `get_block_count` now returns `1` on real and `6` on evil.
5. Pins the wallet to `$FP_REAL` and points it at the real daemon (baseline). `refresh` + `get_height` returns height 1. Good.
6. Calls `set_daemon` again to point the wallet at the **evil** daemon, keeping `ssl_allowed_fingerprints=[$FP_REAL]` and `ssl_support="autodetect"`. `refresh` returns:

   ```json
   {"result":{"blocks_fetched":5,"received_money":true}}
   ```

   and `get_height` returns `6`. The wallet, still "pinned" to the real fingerprint, just absorbed the evil daemon's chain. The only log trace is:

   ```
   WARNING  net.ssl  contrib/epee/src/net_ssl.cpp  SSL peer has not been verified
   ```

   No log line says the fingerprint list was malformed or ignored.

7. For contrast, the script restarts the same binary with the CLI flag instead:

   ```
   monero-wallet-rpc --daemon-address 127.0.0.1:49080 --daemon-ssl enabled \
                     --daemon-ssl-allowed-fingerprints "$FP_REAL"
   ```

   `refresh` now fails closed:

   ```json
   {"error":{"code":-38,"message":"no connection to daemon"}}
   ```

   with `SSL certificate is not in the allowed list, connection dropped` in the log. Same binary, same fingerprint, same daemon — the only difference is which decoder the operator's configuration went through.

If you prefer to do it by hand instead of via the script, the core five calls are:

```bash
FP_REAL=$(openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -in real.crt \
          | sed 's/.*=//' | tr -d ':' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

# baseline
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:48090/json_rpc -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "$(cat <<EOF
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"set_daemon","params":{
  "address":"127.0.0.1:48080","trusted":true,"ssl_support":"autodetect",
  "ssl_allowed_fingerprints":["$FP_REAL"]}}
EOF
)"

# bypass

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"set_daemon","params":{
  "address":"127.0.0.1:49080","trusted":true,"ssl_support":"autodetect",

EOF
)"

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:48090/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"refresh"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:48090/json_rpc -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"0","method":"get_height"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Possible Solution

Make the RPC handler do what the CLI path already does:

```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<uint8_t>> ssl_allowed_fingerprints;
ssl_allowed_fingerprints.reserve(req.ssl_allowed_fingerprints.size());
for (const std::string &fp : req.ssl_allowed_fingerprints)
{
  std::vector<uint8_t> decoded;
  try { decoded = epee::from_hex_locale::to_vector(fp); }
  catch (const std::exception &) {
    er.code = WALLET_RPC_ERROR_CODE_NO_DAEMON_CONNECTION;
    er.message = "ssl_allowed_fingerprints[] entries must be hex-encoded SHA-256";
    return false;
  }
  if (decoded.size() != SSL_FINGERPRINT_SIZE) {
    er.code = WALLET_RPC_ERROR_CODE_NO_DAEMON_CONNECTION;
    er.message = "Each fingerprint must decode to exactly 32 bytes";
    return false;
  }
  ssl_allowed_fingerprints.emplace_back(std::move(decoded));
}
```

A couple of defense-in-depth suggestions while you're there:

- The `ssl_options_t(std::vector<std::vector<uint8_t>>, std::string)` constructor in `contrib/epee/src/net_ssl.cpp` should also reject any entry whose size is not `SSL_FINGERPRINT_SIZE`. That would catch any future caller that forgets to hex-decode.
- `has_strong_verification()` currently only looks at the `verification` enum and happily says "strong" for a list of 1000 garbage entries. It should additionally require that every entry have `SSL_FINGERPRINT_SIZE` bytes.
- When `!fingerprints_.empty()` and `has_fingerprint()` returns false, log an `MERROR` that reports the sizes of the stored entries vs the computed digest. Right now an operator has no way to tell "server cert rotated" from "my pinning list was discarded".

## Impact

Anyone who uses `set_daemon` over RPC to pin their daemon's TLS cert (a standard automation pattern for exchanges, payment processors, and pool operators running wallet-rpc against a remote daemon) gets zero pinning. A network attacker between wallet and daemon can swap in any self-signed cert, complete the handshake and MITM the channel: daemon HTTP digest credentials, `/get_outs` and key-image-spent queries, decoy-ring responses used during tx construction, signed transactions submitted for relay, `/start_mining` control payloads. The operator's log shows nothing beyond the same `SSL peer has not been verified` line that you'd get from any `autodetect` connection — so you can't even tell from the log that pinning silently died.

## Note

The proof-of-concept script in `./reports/poc_set_daemon_pinning_bypass.sh` was written with AI assistance to speed up the reproduction scaffolding (cert generation, daemon lifecycle, JSON-RPC plumbing). The vulnerable code path, line references, and manual verification against `release-v0.17`, `release-v0.18`, and `master @ 230de3794` are mine.
