# Q0020: dispatch_as_fallback_account can undercharge real execution cost

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `dispatch_as_fallback_account` with crafted nested call payloads so the runtime charges less weight or fee than the VM, host functions, or nested runtime work actually consume?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/revive/src/lib.rs::dispatch_as_fallback_account
- Entrypoint: public VM / contract execution extrinsic `dispatch_as_fallback_account`
- Attacker controls: nested call payloads
- Exploit idea: Push the largest legal code paths, nested calls, and revert patterns to find a mismatch between charged and real execution cost.
- Invariant to test: Charged weight and fees must upper-bound the exact VM and host work performed.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Chain halt / block-production slowdown from undercharged VM execution
- Fast validation: Fuzz gas, storage-deposit, code size, call depth, and nested-call patterns; compare measured cost to charged cost.
