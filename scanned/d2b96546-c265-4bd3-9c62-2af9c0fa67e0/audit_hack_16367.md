## Details
# Vulnerability where an attacker could manipulate the _mappings storage to make it appear that the next global checkpoint is ready when it actually is not.
## Summary
When settling, it assumes _mappings[context.global.latest + 1].read().ready(context.latestIds) means the global state is ready to move to the next checkpoint. But an attacker could manipulate mappings to make it appear ready when it's not. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The relevant code is in the _settle function: [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L346-L348)
The _mappings[id].ready(ids) check is intended to ensure all markets have reached the next checkpoint id before advancing the global checkpoint.
However, an attacker could manipulate _mappings directly to set _mappings[context.global.latest + 1].ready to true even when markets are not actually ready. This would cause _settle to incorrectly advance the global checkpoint prematurely.

## Impact
• Incorrect global state if markets are settled at different points
• Potential loss of funds if users deposit/redeem based on invalid global state

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
_mappings[id].ready should be replaced with a more robust check that cannot be manipulated, for example:

// check each market directly
for (uint i = 0; i < totalMarkets; i++) {
  if (_registrations[i].currentId <= context.global.latest) {
    // market not ready yet
    return; 
  }
}
// all markets ready, advance global
...

This verifies each market's checkpoint directly rather than relying on the potentially manipulated _mappings.
Additional checks could also be added, like verifying the total collateral in _checkpoints[context.global.latest+1] matches the sum from markets before advancing. This would provide certainty the global state is valid.
