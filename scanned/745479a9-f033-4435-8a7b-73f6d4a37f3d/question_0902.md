# Q0902: linear-interpolate via collateral-remove: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `linear-interpolate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
