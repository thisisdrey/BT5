# [M] Activerecord-session_store Vulnerable to Timing Attack

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-cvw2-xj8r-mjf7
CVE: CVE-2019-25025
CWE: CWE-208
Ecosystem: RubyGems
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2021-03-09
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cvw2-xj8r-mjf7
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- RubyGems: `activerecord-session_store` — affected >=0 <2.0.0

## Details
The `activerecord-session_store` (aka Active Record Session Store) component through 1.1.3 for Ruby on Rails does not use a constant-time approach when delivering information about whether a guessed session ID is valid. Consequently, remote attackers can leverage timing discrepancies to achieve a correct guess in a relatively short amount of time. This is a related issue to CVE-2019-16782. 

## Recommendation

This has been fixed in version 2.0.0.  All users are advised to update to this version or later.
