# [M] SpendProofV1 txid-substitution: get_spend_proof/check_spend_proof do not verify returned transaction hash

## Details
**Repository:** [`monero-project/monero`](https://github.com/monero-project/monero) — `src/wallet/wallet2.cpp`. Snapshot: `master @ 3ad4a5ee8` (`v0.18.1.0-3ad4a5ee8`).

## Summary

Both helpers fetch a pruned transaction with `/gettransactions`, parse it with `get_pruned_tx()`, then build the spend-proof challenge from the **`txid` argument**, not from the hash implied by the blob. Neither compares `tx_hash` (from parsing) to `txid` before signing or verifying. `check_tx_proof()` on the same RPC path does that comparison.

`get_spend_proof` (roughly `wallet2.cpp` 11868–11969): request, parse, then:

```cpp
std::string sig_prefix_data((const char*)&txid, sizeof(crypto::hash));
sig_prefix_data += message;
crypto::hash sig_prefix_hash;
crypto::cn_fast_hash(sig_prefix_data.data(), sig_prefix_data.size(), sig_prefix_hash);
// ring sigs use tx / rings from res.txs[0], not a second hash check
```

`check_spend_proof` (same file, ~11979–12084) repeats the pattern: prefix hash from `txid`, ring checks from the parsed `tx`.

For comparison, after `get_pruned_tx` in `check_tx_proof`:

```cpp
THROW_WALLET_EXCEPTION_IF(tx_hash != txid, error::wallet_internal_error,
    "Failed to get the right transaction from daemon");
```

So if the HTTP peer in front of the wallet is malicious (fake `monerod`, corporate proxy, or on-path MITM), it can answer a request for txid **B** with a valid serialized body for a different tx **A**. The wallet still signs `H(B || message)` while using inputs/key images/rings from **A**. Verifiers that use `check_spend_proof` against the same bad endpoint will see `good: true` for **B** even though nothing in the response actually authenticates **B**.

This is integrity of the spend proof binding, not key exfiltration or remote wallet compromise. You still need a broken or attacker-controlled daemon channel.

## Releases Affected

Re-checked on `master @ 3ad4a5ee8`. The missing `tx_hash == txid` guard is plain in source; any branch with this spend-proof code path behaves the same unless someone already merged an equivalent check.

## Steps to Reproduce

The practical check is end-to-end: real `monerod --regtest`, real `monero-wallet-rpc`, and a tiny Python reverse proxy that forwards to the honest node but, on `POST /gettransactions`, replaces a chosen **FAKE** `txs_hashes` entry with the **REAL** hash of a spend the wallet actually made. The node returns a consistent pruned tx for **A**; the RPC still asks for a proof on **FAKE**. No Monero source edits.

**One command (paths match this machine; adjust `MONERO_BUILD` if your tree lives elsewhere):**

```bash
bash /home/beni/Monero/reports/poc_spend_proof_txid_substitution.sh
```

The script mirrors what you would do by hand: mine and `transfer` on a **direct** daemon URL (so sync is boring), record the real spend txid, bring up the MITM, `set_daemon` to it with `"ssl_support":"disabled"` for plain HTTP, then call `get_spend_proof` with the random **FAKE** id, `check_spend_proof` with the returned signature, and finally point back at the honest daemon to show the same **FAKE** id no longer yields a proof.
{F5813828}
**What you should see in the log:** `SpendProofV1…` returned for **FAKE**, `check_spend_proof` reports `good`, then after dropping the MITM the wallet errors on `get_spend_proof` for **FAKE** (e.g. missing / wrong `txs` count).

Build the binaries once from the official tree, Release, no patches — same idea as the other lab scripts in `reports/`.

If you hate shell wrappers, the two attachments that matter are:

- `reports/poc_spend_proof_txid_substitution.sh`
- `reports/poc_spend_proof_txid_substitution_proxy.py`

## Possible Solution

After `get_pruned_tx(res.txs[0], tx, tx_hash)` succeeds in **both** `get_spend_proof` and `check_spend_proof`, add the same guard as `check_tx_proof`:

```cpp
THROW_WALLET_EXCEPTION_IF(tx_hash != txid, error::wallet_internal_error,
    "Failed to get the right transaction from daemon");
```

Add a regression test (daemon fixture or mocked HTTP) that returns a blob whose id does not match the requested hash; both entry points should bail before signing or verifying.

## Impact

A malicious, compromised, or MITM daemon can break the integrity binding of SpendProofV1.

`get_spend_proof` and `check_spend_proof` are supposed to operate on the transaction identified by the caller-supplied `txid`. However, because the parsed transaction hash is not compared against that `txid`, the daemon can return transaction body A for a request for txid B. The wallet then builds/verifies the spend-proof challenge over B while using the inputs, key images, and rings from A.

In the PoC, a random FAKE txid cannot produce a spend proof against the honest daemon. When `/gettransactions` is MITM-substituted with a real wallet-originated transaction body, `get_spend_proof(txid=FAKE)` succeeds and `check_spend_proof(txid=FAKE, signature=...)` returns `good:true` behind the same malicious daemon.

This can mislead services or automation that rely on `check_spend_proof` as evidence that a user created/spent a specific transaction id, if their wallet-rpc verifier is connected to an attacker-controlled, compromised, or MITM'd daemon.

This is not a private-key leak, fund theft, consensus issue, or RCE. The precondition is control of the wallet-to-daemon response path. The impact is proof authenticity/integrity failure.

## Note

Drafting and the PoC wiring had editor/AI help; line numbers, script runs, and daemon behaviour were checked against the local tree/build.
