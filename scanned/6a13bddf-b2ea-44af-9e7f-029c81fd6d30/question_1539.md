# Q1539: get-asset-value via liquidate-multi: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
`get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-asset-value` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
