# Q1577: Loan NFT lock and nonce state: nonce observer / mixed read / nonce fidelity

## Question
Can an unprivileged current owner, approved address, buyer, or seller using ordinary NFT actions enter through `LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom` with a downstream vault or observer that relies on ownershipNonce and ownerAndUnlocker after user-controlled transfers while the token was just unlocked after a prior listing or transfer cycle and make downstream code observe an owner and unlocker pair that belong to different epochs, breaking the rule that every ownership-set change should bump ownershipNonce for the affected addresses exactly once and leading to Loans NFT being stuck or its cashflow rights becoming unavailable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansNFT.sol / lock, unlock, _update
- Entrypoint: LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom
- Attacker controls: a downstream vault or observer that relies on ownershipNonce and ownerAndUnlocker after user-controlled transfers
- Exploit idea: make downstream code observe an owner and unlocker pair that belong to different epochs
- Invariant to test: every ownership-set change should bump ownershipNonce for the affected addresses exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being stuck or its cashflow rights becoming unavailable
- Fast validation: Forge test per-token approvals, lock/unlock cycles, and transfers, then assert nonce, owner, and unlocker views stay in one epoch.
