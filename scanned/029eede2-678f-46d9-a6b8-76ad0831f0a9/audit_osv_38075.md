## Details
iccDEV provides a set of libraries and tools for working with ICC color management profiles. Prior to version 2.3.1.6, a crafted ICC profile can trigger a stack-buffer-overflow (SBO) in CIccCalculatorFunc::Apply() when processed via iccApplyNamedCmm. Under AddressSanitizer, the failure is reported as a 4-byte write stack-buffer-overflow in IccProfLib/IccMpeCalc.cpp:3873, reachable through the MPE calculator / curve set initialization path. This issue has been patched in version 2.3.1.6.
