# Q2290: Vault async redeem flow: split owner-controller / ratio drift / global reserve sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses while idleLiquidity is just above the approved reserve and later user activity could consume nearby balances and make claimableRedeemShares and claimableRedeemAssets decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: make claimableRedeemShares and claimableRedeemAssets decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals
- Fast validation: Fuzz operator churn around redeem claims and ensure only the current authorized controller path can consume reserved assets.
