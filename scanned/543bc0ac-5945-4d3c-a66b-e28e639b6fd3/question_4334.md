# Q4334: receive-underlying via transfer: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, can an unprivileged attacker make `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account, so the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `transfer` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation varied, and assert that the value `receive-underlying` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
