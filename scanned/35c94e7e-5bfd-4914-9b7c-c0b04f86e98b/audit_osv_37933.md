# [M] Apache Traffic Server: Buffer overflow via Host field that has a long string value

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-33930
CVSS: 6.0 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)
Published: 2026-07-29
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-33930
Type: osv

## Details
Apache Traffic Server copies the client Host header into a fixed-size stack buffer without a bound during redirect handling, so an over-long Host header overflows the stack when redirect following is enabled.

This issue affects Apache Traffic Server: from 8.0.0 through 8.1.9, from 9.0.0 through 9.2.14, from 10.0.0 through 10.1.3.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.2.15 or 10.1.4, which fix the issue.
