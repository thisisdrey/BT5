# Q5190: next-index via collateral-remove: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, can an unprivileged attacker make `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `next-index` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
