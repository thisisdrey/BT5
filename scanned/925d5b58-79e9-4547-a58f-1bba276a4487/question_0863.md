# Q863: initialize: migrated or delegated authority path accepts the wrong signer [init-under-boundary-conditions-for] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `initialize` from `initialize_account` with init under boundary conditions for flags and counters that start non-zero so a migrated, delegated, or PDA-owned account accepts the wrong authority, violating `new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context` and causing `High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `initialize`
- Entrypoint: `initialize_account`
- Attacker controls: init under boundary conditions for flags and counters that start non-zero
- Exploit idea: Check all alternate authorization paths for mismatched signer identity, stale authority fields, or incorrect PDA derivation assumptions. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze
- Fast validation: Model authority transfer/migration and verify that only the intended signer path can mutate or close the account at each phase. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
