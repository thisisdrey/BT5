cgroup/dmem: avoid pool UAF

An UAF issue was observed:

BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in page_counter_uncharge+0x65/0x150
Write of size 8 at addr ffff888106715440 by task insmod/527

Freed by task 0:

The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff888106715400
which belongs to the cache kmalloc-512 of size 512
The buggy address is located 64 bytes inside of
freed 512-byte region [ffff888106715400, ffff888106715600)

The buggy address belongs to the physical page:

Memory state around the buggy address:
ffff888106715300: fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc
ffff888106715380: fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc

ffff888106715500: fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb

The issue occurs because a pool can still be held by a caller after its
associated memory region is unregistered. The current implementation frees
the pool even if users still hold references to it (e.g., before uncharge
operations complete).

This patch adds a reference counter to each pool, ensuring that a pool is
only freed when its reference count drops to zero.
