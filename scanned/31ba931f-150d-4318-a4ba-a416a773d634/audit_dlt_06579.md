**Description**\

first of all we have to take into considerations that `VOTE_DELAY` can be at `MAX_VOTE_DELAY` due to this check

```solidity
    function setVoteDelay(uint256 _delay) external VoterAdmin {
        require(_delay != VOTE_DELAY, "already set");
        require(_delay <= MAX_VOTE_DELAY, "max delay"); <<@
        emit SetVoteDelay(VOTE_DELAY, _delay);
        VOTE_DELAY = _delay;
    }
```
taking into considerations that `VOTE_DELAY` may be actually 1 Week then we see that at 

```solidity
    function vote(uint256 _tokenId, address[] calldata _poolVote, uint256[] calldata _weights) external nonReentrant {
        _voteDelay(_tokenId);
        require(IVotingEscrow(_ve).isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, _tokenId), "!approved/Owner");
        require(_poolVote.length == _weights.length, "Pool/Weights length !=");
        _vote(_tokenId, _poolVote, _weights);
        lastVoted[_tokenId] = _epochTimestamp() + 1; <<@
    }
```
we set `lastVoted` to the start of the current epoch

the problem rises from the fact that users unintentially may vote for killed `Gauges` without knowing that they are killed and in `_vote` there is no check for reverts for current scenario

```solidity
    function _vote(uint256 _tokenId, address[] memory _poolVote, uint256[] memory _weights) internal {
......    SKIP

        for (uint i = 0; i < _poolCnt; i++) {
            if (isAlive[gauges[_poolVote[i]]]) _totalVoteWeight += _weights[i];
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _poolCnt; i++) {
            address _pool = _poolVote[i];
            address _gauge = gauges[_pool];

            if (isGauge[_gauge] && isAlive[_gauge]) {
......    SKIP
                require(votes[_tokenId][_pool] == 0);
                require(_poolWeight != 0);
......    SKIP
            }
        }
        if (_usedWeight > 0) IVotingEscrow(_ve).voting(_tokenId);
        totalWeightsPerEpoch[_time] += _totalWeight;
    }
```

as we see checks and potential reverts are inside the `if (isGauge[_gauge] && isAlive[_gauge])` of the loop 
and this `if` statement won't come to be true

then this will lead to txn bein executed with no revert and the `lastVoted[_tokenId] = _epochTimestamp() + 1;` would be set in `vote` with no problems

now during the `_voteDelay` check, this will always revert and will lead to user losing the rewards of the current epoch

**Attack Scenario**\

1. User see see good Gauges and vote for them in epochs and get good rewards in epoch 1
2. `Governance` kills the Gauges
3. User's voting balance increase and he wants to increse his votes in the gauag -> votes for the killed Gauges in epoch 2
4. Txn executes and doesn't revert
5. User will get no rewards for the epoch 2 if `VOTE_DELAY` == `MAX_VOTE_DELAY` or `MAX_VOTE_DELAY` - 1
