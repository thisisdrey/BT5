# Q2169: Vault async deposit flow: partial claim / price-lock break / proportional decay

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with alternating deposit() and mint() claims against the same claimable position while a holdings or ledger change zeroes `lastNavUpdate` between request and the next approval cycle and make the shares claimed exceed the approval-time price lock for the same controller, breaking the rule that claimableDepositAssets[controller] and claimableDepositShares[controller] should decay proportionally to the actual claim and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess vault-share minting?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: alternating deposit() and mint() claims against the same claimable position
- Exploit idea: make the shares claimed exceed the approval-time price lock for the same controller
- Invariant to test: claimableDepositAssets[controller] and claimableDepositShares[controller] should decay proportionally to the actual claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess vault-share minting
- Fast validation: Assert that direct operator churn around request and claim never changes who can consume a controller's approved value.
