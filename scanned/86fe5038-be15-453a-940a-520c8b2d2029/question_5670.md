# Q5670: socialize-debt via borrow: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the future mask produced by the new debt bit, can an unprivileged attacker make `socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `socialize-debt` writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944` -> `socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt` writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`. Reach it through `borrow` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the future mask produced by the new debt bit across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `socialize-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
