# Q0176: Loans create authorization: role overlap / toxic loan seed / downstream safety

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with the same attacker-controlled address reused across multiple loan roles while the target counterparty addresses are registered and unregistered across attacker-controlled books in nearby transactions and seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate, breaking the rule that an unprivileged caller should never be able to create a loan whose later funding, withdrawal, or pricing can touch another user without a real originator approval and leading to Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: the same attacker-controlled address reused across multiple loan roles
- Exploit idea: seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate
- Invariant to test: an unprivileged caller should never be able to create a loan whose later funding, withdrawal, or pricing can touch another user without a real originator approval
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user
- Fast validation: Build a minimal scenario where a toxic loan would later be fundable or priceable, and assert the creation step itself cannot be reached by an unprivileged caller.
