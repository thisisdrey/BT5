# Q0755: receipt-to-transaction backfill consistency — pending_transaction_queue.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`, receipts whose originating transaction hash is attacker-influenced, when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit, reach `get_or_create` in `chain/client/src/pending_transaction_queue.rs` and break the receipt-to-transaction mapping so outcomes are attributed to the wrong transaction, breaking the invariant that every receipt maps to exactly one originating transaction, leading to High - Unintended chain split (network partition)?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/client/src/pending_transaction_queue.rs` :: `get_or_create`
- Entrypoint: an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`
- Attacker controls: receipts whose originating transaction hash is attacker-influenced; when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit
- Exploit idea: break the receipt-to-transaction mapping so outcomes are attributed to the wrong transaction
- Invariant to test: every receipt maps to exactly one originating transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Unintended chain split (network partition)
- Fast validation: test asserting the mapping over crafted receipt chains
