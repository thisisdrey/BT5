# [M] apache-airflow DAG source authorization bypass exposes co-located DAG source

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-4fh7-7jx4-8f6c
CVE: CVE-2026-49296
CWE: CWE-639
Ecosystem: PyPI
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-07-07
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4fh7-7jx4-8f6c
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- PyPI: `apache-airflow` — affected >=0 <3.3.0

## Details
Before apache-airflow 3.3.0, a user authorized to read one Dag could disclose the source of other Dags co-located in the same source file. `GET /api/v2/dagSources/{dag_id}` — and the equivalent Dag-source view in the UI — returned the entire source file without redacting Dags the caller was not authorized to read, bypassing per-DAG read authorization. Deployments that co-locate multiple Dags in a single file and rely on per-DAG access control to limit source visibility are affected; single-Dag-per-file deployments are not. Upgrade to apache-airflow 3.3.0 or later.
