# Q0404: event - postponed burn events decouple from the actual state change (2)

## Question
Given the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through a `FtWithdraw` / `MtWithdraw` / `NftWithdraw` / `NativeWithdraw` / `StorageDeposit` / `AuthCall` intent inside `execute_intents`, exploit that `REFUND_MEMO` in `crates/near/utils/src/event.rs` defers `mt_burn` emission to the end of the transaction while balances change immediately, so an off-chain indexer or a same-receipt consumer acts on a state it cannot yet observe, breaking the invariant `the burn events emitted by a receipt == the balance reductions that receipt committed` and leading to temporary freezing of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/near/utils/src/event.rs](crates/near/utils/src/event.rs) - `REFUND_MEMO`
- Entrypoint: a `FtWithdraw` / `MtWithdraw` / `NftWithdraw` / `NativeWithdraw` / `StorageDeposit` / `AuthCall` intent inside `execute_intents`
- Attacker controls: every field of the withdrawal intent, including `msg`, `min_gas`, `state_init` and `attached_deposit`
- Exploit idea: `self.runtime.postponed_burns` batches burns; probe whether a failing later step leaves emitted-but-unapplied or applied-but-unemitted events. Set-up: the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value.
- Invariant to test: the burn events emitted by a receipt == the balance reductions that receipt committed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of user funds
- Fast validation: Abort a batch after a postponed burn is queued; assert no burn event is emitted.
