# Q1976: Stake/unstake in the same action list — lib.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a single transaction batching many actions against an attacker-owned receiver, Stake(x) followed by Stake(0) in one list, repeated across blocks at epoch boundaries, when combined with a DeployContract earlier in the same action list, reach the primary handler in this file in `runtime/runtime/src/lib.rs` and leave balance permanently locked or double-unlocked across the epoch transition, breaking the invariant that unstaked balance becomes withdrawable exactly once, after the protocol unlock delay, leading to Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/runtime/src/lib.rs` :: primary handler
- Entrypoint: a single transaction batching many actions against an attacker-owned receiver
- Attacker controls: Stake(x) followed by Stake(0) in one list, repeated across blocks at epoch boundaries; when combined with a DeployContract earlier in the same action list
- Exploit idea: leave balance permanently locked or double-unlocked across the epoch transition
- Invariant to test: unstaked balance becomes withdrawable exactly once, after the protocol unlock delay
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)
- Fast validation: test-loop test running stake/unstake across an epoch boundary
