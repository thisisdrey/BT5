# Q3869: Smart account deployment and initialization: init arrays / foreign context configure / one-shot configure

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer while a second configuration attempt is made against a Safe that already ran initialization once and make an attacker use the factory's configuration logic to alter a Safe or Safe-like context it should not own, breaking the rule that `configureSmartAccount` should run at most once and only in the intended delegatecall context of a fresh Safe and leading to Bypass of intended Safe initialization or module-setup permissions?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer
- Exploit idea: make an attacker use the factory's configuration logic to alter a Safe or Safe-like context it should not own
- Invariant to test: `configureSmartAccount` should run at most once and only in the intended delegatecall context of a fresh Safe
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended Safe initialization or module-setup permissions
- Fast validation: Model predicted-address observation and deployment races and ensure a third party cannot change who effectively controls the resulting account.
