# Q1023: can_be_closed: account migration duplicates or strands value [an-account-where-active-order] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `close_account` with an account where active order count and balance count can diverge at boundaries so `can_be_closed` duplicates, drops, or strands balances during account migration or transfer, violating `closeability must require the full absence of live economic exposure, blocking flags, and value-bearing side state` and causing `High: permanent loss, stranding, or unauthorized release of live exposure`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `can_be_closed`
- Entrypoint: `close_account`
- Attacker controls: an account where active order count and balance count can diverge at boundaries
- Exploit idea: Probe migration edges where balances, fees, or authorities are copied then cleared, especially if one half can be replayed or partially completed. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: closeability must require the full absence of live economic exposure, blocking flags, and value-bearing side state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent loss, stranding, or unauthorized release of live exposure
- Fast validation: Simulate partial completion and replay attempts, then assert total exposure across old and new accounts stays conserved. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
