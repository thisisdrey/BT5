## Details
# Signature can be reused when filling the order because the outdated openzeppelin version is used.

## Summary

Signature can be reused when filling the order because the outdated openzeppelin version is used.

## Vulnerability Detail

We check if the order is valid using the code below:

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Checks if an order is valid
     * @param order The order/contract
     * @param orderHash The EIP712 hash of the order
     * @param signature The signature of the order hashed
     */
    function checkIsValidOrder(Order calldata order, bytes32 orderHash, bytes calldata signature) public view {
        // Check that the signature is valid
        require(isValidSignature(order.maker, orderHash, signature), "INVALID_SIGNATURE");

        // Check that this order is still valid
        require(order.validity > block.timestamp, "EXPIRED_VALIDITY_TIME");

        // Check that this order was not canceled
        require(!canceledOrders[orderHash], "ORDER_CANCELED");

        // Check that the nonce is valid
        require(order.nonce >= minimumValidNonce[order.maker], "INVALID_NONCE");
        
        // Check that this contract will expire in the future
        require(order.expiry > order.validity, "INVALID_EXPIRY_TIME");

        // Check that fees match
        require(order.fee >= fee, "INVALID_FEE");

        // Check that this is an approved ERC20 token
        require(allowedAsset[order.asset], "INVALID_ASSET");

        // Check that this if an approved ERC721 collection
        require(allowedCollection[order.collection], "INVALID_COLLECTION");

        // Check that there is no bull set for this order -> not matched
        require(bulls[uint(orderHash)] == address(0), "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED");
    }
```

note the line:

```solidity
        // Check that this order was not canceled
        require(!canceledOrders[orderHash], "ORDER_CANCELED");
```

and 

```solidity
    // Check that there is no bull set for this order -> not matched
    require(bulls[uint(orderHash)] == address(0), "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED");
```

and 

```solidity
        // Check that the signature is valid
        require(isValidSignature(order.maker, orderHash, signature), "INVALID_SIGNATURE");
```

we are not incrementing the nonce, we just mark the order hash as canceled or filled. 

And we are using an outdated openzeppelin version:

Which is vulnerable to signature reuse attack:

https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-35961

> OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The functions `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` are vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a single `bytes` argument, and not the functions that take `r, v, s` or `r, vs` as separate arguments. The potentially affected contracts are those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this protection. The issue has been patched in 4.7.3.

## Impact

The signature can be reused when filling the order because the outdated openzeppelin version is used.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend update the openzeppelin to 4.7.3 version or later version to avoid the issue. Also please increment the nonce   after verifying the signature.
