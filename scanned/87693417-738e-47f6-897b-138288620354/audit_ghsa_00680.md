# [M] Timing attack on django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-m38j-pmg3-v5x5
CVE: CVE-2020-4071
CWE: CWE-208
Ecosystem: PyPI
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2020-06-23
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m38j-pmg3-v5x5
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- PyPI: `django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist` — affected >=0 <0.3.4

## Details
### Impact

Potential timing attack exists on websites where the basic authentication is used or configured, i.e. `BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` is set. Currently the string comparison between configured credentials and the ones provided by users is performed through a character-by-character string comparison. This enables a possibility that attacker may time the time it takes the server to validate different usernames and password, and use this knowledge to work out the valid credentials. This attack is understood not to be realistic over the Internet. However, it may be achieved from within local networks where the website is hosted, e.g. from inside a data centre where a website's server is located.

Sites protected by IP address whitelisting only are unaffected by this vulnerability.

### Patches
This vulnerability has been fixed on version 0.3.4 of django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist. Update to version 0.3.4 as soon as possible and change basic authentication username and password configured on a Django project using this package.

### Workarounds
Stop using basic authentication and use the IP whitelisting component only. It can be achieved by not setting `BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` in Django project settings.
