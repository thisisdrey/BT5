# Q2708: create_with_pool_id can write state that another public path misreads

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `create_with_pool_id` to create or mutate storage that a different public entrypoint later interprets more permissively than intended?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/nomination-pools/src/lib.rs::create_with_pool_id
- Entrypoint: signed extrinsic `create_with_pool_id`
- Attacker controls: amounts, fees, or prices, IDs, hashes, nonces, or location fields
- Exploit idea: Look for state shared across multiple public entrypoints but validated differently by each one.
- Invariant to test: Shared storage must have one consistent meaning across every public path that consumes it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft of user funds / unbacked mint or pool insolvency
- Fast validation: After exercising the entrypoint, call every other public function that touches the same object family and check for inconsistent interpretation.
