# Q3000: resolve-ztoken via liquidate-redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault whose share price the redemption moves reach `resolve-ztoken` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343` -> `resolve-ztoken`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ztoken` reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault whose share price the redemption moves across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `resolve-ztoken` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
