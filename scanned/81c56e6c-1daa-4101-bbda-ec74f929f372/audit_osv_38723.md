# [M] Wallos: SSRF CGNAT Bypass in subscription/payments Logo URL — is_cgnat_ip() Not Used in Inline Checks

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-41687
Aliases: GHSA-4v59-hghw-7gc2
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Type: osv

## Details
Wallos is an open-source, self-hostable personal subscription tracker. Prior to version 4.8.1, the SSRF protection in endpoints/subscription/add.php (line 42) and endpoints/payments/add.php (line 40) uses an inline IP validation check (FILTER_FLAG_NO_PRIV_RANGE | FILTER_FLAG_NO_RES_RANGE) that does not block CGNAT addresses (100.64.0.0/10, RFC 6598). The includes/ssrf_helper.php file explicitly defines is_cgnat_ip() to cover this gap (used by notification endpoints), but the logo/icon URL fetching in subscription and payment endpoints performs its own inline validation that misses this range. This allows authenticated users to perform Blind SSRF to internal services in Tailscale, Carrier-Grade NAT, and other environments using 100.64.0.0/10 addresses. This issue has been patched in version 4.8.1.
