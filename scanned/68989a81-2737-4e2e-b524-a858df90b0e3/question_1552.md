# Q1552: is_compute_budget_program arithmetic overflows on reachable values (compute_budget_program_id_filter.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `is_compute_budget_program` in `compute-budget-instruction/src/compute_budget_program_id_filter.rs` with values chosen so the arithmetic saturates, wraps, or rounds toward the attacker, and make the arithmetic in `is_compute_budget_program` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `compute-budget-instruction/src/compute_budget_program_id_filter.rs` -> `is_compute_budget_program()` (around line 21)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: values chosen so the arithmetic saturates, wraps, or rounds toward the attacker
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `is_compute_budget_program` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `is_compute_budget_program` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged remote client can send TPU/QUIC traffic or transaction packets that panic, deadlock, or unboundedly grow memory in ingress, sigverify, scheduling, or PoH, halting block production across the cluster.
