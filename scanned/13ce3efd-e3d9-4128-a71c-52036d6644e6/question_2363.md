# Q2363: Vault async redeem flow: operator churn / free asset edge / burned-share fairness

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with operator approvals added or removed around request, approval, and claim boundaries while idleLiquidity is just above the approved reserve and later user activity could consume nearby balances and make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side, breaking the rule that shares burned at approval should never let a controller withdraw more assets than the approval-time NAV allowed and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: operator approvals added or removed around request, approval, and claim boundaries
- Exploit idea: make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side
- Invariant to test: shares burned at approval should never let a controller withdraw more assets than the approval-time NAV allowed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals
- Fast validation: Fuzz operator churn around redeem claims and ensure only the current authorized controller path can consume reserved assets.
