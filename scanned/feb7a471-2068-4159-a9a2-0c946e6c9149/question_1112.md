# Q1112: interpolate-rate via repay: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `repay` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) varied, and assert that the value `interpolate-rate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
