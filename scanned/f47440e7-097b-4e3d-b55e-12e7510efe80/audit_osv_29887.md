# [C] GHSL-2024-094: GStreamer has an OOB-write in isomp4/qtdemux.c

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: CVE-2024-47537
CVSS: 9.0 (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)
Published: 2024-12-11
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2024-47537
Type: osv

## Details
GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to by stream->samples to accommodate stream->n_samples + samples_count elements of type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from the input file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integer overflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocate memory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended. Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements and attempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceeding the actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.
