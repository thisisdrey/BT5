# Q3741: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: nft route / allowance replay / per-safe route binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances while the route is configured with an infinite ERC20 allowance and long validity and consume more than a finite allowance by exploiting repeated-call or cross-route accounting boundaries, breaking the rule that delegate rights and allowances should bind to one exact `(safe, token-or-collection, recipient)` route only and leading to Protocol-facing unauthorized transfers that later harm another user or vault?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances
- Exploit idea: consume more than a finite allowance by exploiting repeated-call or cross-route accounting boundaries
- Invariant to test: delegate rights and allowances should bind to one exact `(safe, token-or-collection, recipient)` route only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol-facing unauthorized transfers that later harm another user or vault
- Fast validation: Check that neighboring recipients, collections, or tokens cannot be reached through a superficially similar approved route.
