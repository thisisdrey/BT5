# Q3842: Smart account deployment and initialization: init arrays / init replay / predictability

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer while the factory is deploying a brand-new Safe through the standard proxy path and make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe, breaking the rule that the predicted address for a given deployer, nonce, and initializer should match exactly one controllable deployment outcome and leading to Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer
- Exploit idea: make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe
- Invariant to test: the predicted address for a given deployer, nonce, and initializer should match exactly one controllable deployment outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account
- Fast validation: Check that no foreign Safe or Safe-like contract can abuse the factory's delegatecall-based initializer to install new module state.
