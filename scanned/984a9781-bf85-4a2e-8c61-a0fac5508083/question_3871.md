# Q3871: Smart account deployment and initialization: init arrays / foreign context configure / initializer fidelity

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer while a second configuration attempt is made against a Safe that already ran initialization once and make an attacker use the factory's configuration logic to alter a Safe or Safe-like context it should not own, breaking the rule that duplicate or crafted array inputs should not silently widen module delegates or spending surface beyond the explicit initializer semantics and leading to Theft or redirection of value sent to a predicted or freshly deployed smart account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer
- Exploit idea: make an attacker use the factory's configuration logic to alter a Safe or Safe-like context it should not own
- Invariant to test: duplicate or crafted array inputs should not silently widen module delegates or spending surface beyond the explicit initializer semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or redirection of value sent to a predicted or freshly deployed smart account
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated delegatecall attempts into `configureSmartAccount` and assert the one-shot guard holds in every reachable context.
