# Q1613: get_price_of_type: confidence or freshness enforcement is applied inconsistently [a-price-context-at-freshness] [freshness]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_price_of_type` through `lending_account_borrow` with a price context at freshness or confidence boundaries so confidence/freshness checks are enforced on one branch but not the branch that settles value, violating `the priced value used to admit borrowing must come from the exact configured price source and intended conservative price type` and causing `Critical: unbacked borrowing or solvency loss from misvaluation`? Focus specifically on freshness/confidence boundaries and whether the settling branch applies the same policy as the admitting branch.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/price.rs` / `get_price_of_type`
- Entrypoint: `lending_account_borrow`
- Attacker controls: a price context at freshness or confidence boundaries
- Exploit idea: Check whether all price-consuming branches use the same freshness and confidence policy before accepting state transitions. Focus specifically on freshness/confidence boundaries and whether the settling branch applies the same policy as the admitting branch.
- Invariant to test: the priced value used to admit borrowing must come from the exact configured price source and intended conservative price type
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: unbacked borrowing or solvency loss from misvaluation
- Fast validation: Feed boundary-age or high-confidence-spread contexts and assert no branch can accept if the canonical policy would reject. Build price contexts just inside and outside freshness or confidence limits and assert no mixed-policy acceptance occurs.
