# Q0035: Loans create authorization: self-book spoof / unauthorized create / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with only a self-curated address book plus attacker-controlled borrower, investor, and servicer addresses while the target counterparty addresses are registered and unregistered across attacker-controlled books in nearby transactions and make `create` accept a caller that is neither the approved originator nor an admin/guardian, breaking the rule that borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and role-based access control?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: only a self-curated address book plus attacker-controlled borrower, investor, and servicer addresses
- Exploit idea: make `create` accept a caller that is neither the approved originator nor an admin/guardian
- Invariant to test: borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and role-based access control
- Fast validation: Forge test a caller with only self-book registrations and assert `create` cannot succeed unless the canonical originator book explicitly approves the caller.
