# Q5196: insert via liquidate-multi: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `insert` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
