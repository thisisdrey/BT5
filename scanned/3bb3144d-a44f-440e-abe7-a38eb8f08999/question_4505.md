# Q4505: subset via collateral-remove-redeem: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), drive `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) — which tests bitmask containment — to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, breaking the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
