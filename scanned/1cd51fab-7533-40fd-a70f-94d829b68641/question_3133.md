# Q3133: create via liquidate-multi: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, drive `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) — which binds a principal to a fresh numeric id — to make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist, breaking the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, then read `create` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
