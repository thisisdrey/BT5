# Q5311: normalize-pyth via supply-collateral-add: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`normalize-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297) computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `amount`, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297` -> `normalize-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `normalize-pyth` computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `normalize-pyth` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
