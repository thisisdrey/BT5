# Q3361: TrustedCalls delegate execution: batch order / safe confusion / per-safe auth

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with the order of several batched trusted calls that share state across the same Safe or target while another Safe in the system has different delegates or target trust expectations and make a delegate of one Safe execute a call from another Safe or another trust context, breaking the rule that a delegate authorization should apply only to the exact Safe that granted it and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and Safe-module access control?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: the order of several batched trusted calls that share state across the same Safe or target
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe execute a call from another Safe or another trust context
- Invariant to test: a delegate authorization should apply only to the exact Safe that granted it
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and Safe-module access control
- Fast validation: Forge test one delegate address across multiple Safes and assert each execute path remains bound to the granting Safe only.
