# Q0937: write-feed via call-ststx-ratio: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, drive `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) — which applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status — to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, breaking the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, then read `write-feed` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
