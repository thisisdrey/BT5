# Q1204: Investor withdrawal routing: mixed balances / wrong recipient / no stale unlocker

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value while a vault, exchange, or later counterparty relies on the same payable balances after the batch and make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans, breaking the rule that a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch and leading to Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: a batch where some loans have only principal, some only interest, and some zero withdrawable value
- Exploit idea: make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans
- Invariant to test: a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party
- Fast validation: Model sale-offer settlement or cancellation around `investorWithdraw` and assert no stale unlocker or stale owner can claim old payables.
