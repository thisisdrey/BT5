# Q0079: Loans create authorization: originator mismatch / toxic loan seed / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with a fake `originator` parameter that names another address while the attacker remains `msg.sender` while the canonical address book already contains at least one genuinely approved originator and seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate, breaking the rule that borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only and leading to Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: a fake `originator` parameter that names another address while the attacker remains `msg.sender`
- Exploit idea: seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate
- Invariant to test: borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user
- Fast validation: Build a minimal scenario where a toxic loan would later be fundable or priceable, and assert the creation step itself cannot be reached by an unprivileged caller.
