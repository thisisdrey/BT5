# Q3026: Address-book role bit isolation: zero-like target / bit confusion / book isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with edge-case grantee addresses such as zero-like or contract addresses the attacker controls while a later `createOffer` or `acceptOffer` flow will read the investor bit from both sides' books and make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role, breaking the rule that a self-managed address book should never satisfy canonical-book checks or another owner's checks and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: edge-case grantee addresses such as zero-like or contract addresses the attacker controls
- Exploit idea: make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role
- Invariant to test: a self-managed address book should never satisfy canonical-book checks or another owner's checks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules
- Fast validation: Model one self-managed book plus the canonical book and assert they can never substitute for each other.
