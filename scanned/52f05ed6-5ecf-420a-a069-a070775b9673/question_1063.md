# Q1063: Investor withdrawal routing: ownership churn / double claim / batch isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts while a sale offer was recently accepted or cancelled before the batch executes and make one payable balance claimable in two ownership or lock epochs, breaking the rule that batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts
- Exploit idea: make one payable balance claimable in two ownership or lock epochs
- Invariant to test: batch authorization and recipient caching should never merge entitlements across loans that only appear similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution across investors, buyers, or sellers
- Fast validation: Fuzz batched loan ordering and payable compositions and assert the first loan's cached recipient never bleeds into another loan improperly.
