## Details
# closableAmount could go below zero, causing revert when loading pending positions
## Summary
closableAmount could go below zero, causing revert when loading pending positions.
## Vulnerability Detail
closableAmount is not calculated correctly and could go below zero in some cases.
Example:
latestPosition magnitude = 20
pendingLocalPositions magnitude = [30, 15 , 8]

i = 0 (First iterate):
closeableAmountBefore = 20, previousMagnitude = 20
closeableAmountAfter  = 20 - (20 - min( 30, 20)) = 20 - (20 - 20) = 20 - 0 = 20

i = 1 (Second iterate):
closeableAmountBefore = 20, previousMagnitude = 30
closeableAmountAfter  = 20 - (30 - min( 15, 30)) = 20 - (30 - 15) = 20 -15 = 5

i = 2 (Third iterate):
closeableAmountBefore = 5, previousMagnitude = 15
closeableAmountAfter  = 5 - (15 - min( 8, 15)) = 5 - (15 - 8) = 5 - 7 = -2 (which is below 0)

## Impact
System DOS in some cases
