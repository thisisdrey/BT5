# Q2760: Vault NAV freshness and cross-contract state: cashflow withdrawal timing / stale ledger / no stale claims

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower, investor, buyer, seller, or shareholder interacting through ordinary protocol entrypoints enter through `Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals` with ordinary investor-withdraw or cashflow-collection timing around a vault-held position while the vault already has a recently finalized `lastNav`, `lastOwnershipNonce`, and `lastCalculatorConfigurationVersion` and make a user-controlled entitlement or cashflow change create a price-sensitive stale-state window across approvals, breaking the rule that an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone and leading to Protocol state bricking or repeated approval blockage if freshness invalidation can be bypassed or inconsistently triggered?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / _requireFreshNav, updateNav, collectCashflows, fundLoans, createSaleOffer, acceptSaleOffer
- Entrypoint: Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals
- Attacker controls: ordinary investor-withdraw or cashflow-collection timing around a vault-held position
- Exploit idea: make a user-controlled entitlement or cashflow change create a price-sensitive stale-state window across approvals
- Invariant to test: an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol state bricking or repeated approval blockage if freshness invalidation can be bypassed or inconsistently triggered
- Fast validation: Model borrower payments and external offer settlements right before manager approvals and assert no stale snapshot remains usable.
