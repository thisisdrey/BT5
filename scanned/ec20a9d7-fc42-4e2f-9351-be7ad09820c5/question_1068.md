# Q1068: get-available-assets via deposit: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call reach `get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `deposit` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `get-available-assets` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
