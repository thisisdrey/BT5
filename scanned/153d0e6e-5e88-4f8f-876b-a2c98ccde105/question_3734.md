# Q3734: accrue-user-debts via liquidate: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only, so the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `liquidate` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-debts` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
