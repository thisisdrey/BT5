# Q4154: accrue via deposit: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling `recipient`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `deposit` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with `recipient`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `accrue` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
