# [H] net: rose: convert 'use' field to refcount_t

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2025-39826
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2025-09-16
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2025-39826
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=2.6.12 <6.1.150, >=6.2.0 <6.6.104, >=6.7.0 <6.12.45, >=6.13.0 <6.16.5

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: rose: convert 'use' field to refcount_t

The 'use' field in struct rose_neigh is used as a reference counter but
lacks atomicity. This can lead to race conditions where a rose_neigh
structure is freed while still being referenced by other code paths.

For example, when rose_neigh->use becomes zero during an ioctl operation
via rose_rt_ioctl(), the structure may be removed while its timer is
still active, potentially causing use-after-free issues.

This patch changes the type of 'use' from unsigned short to refcount_t and
updates all code paths to use rose_neigh_hold() and rose_neigh_put() which
operate reference counts atomically.
