# Q0257: system-repay via liquidate: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, drive `system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) — which splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid` — to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, breaking the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `liquidate` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
