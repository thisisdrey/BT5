# Q0207: open_queue result depends on batch ordering (device.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `open_queue` in `xdp/src/device.rs` with a batch crafted so scheduling reorders it relative to fee priority, and make the committed result depend on the scheduler's internal ordering rather than the block order, so that the invariant "Committed state is a function of the block's transaction order, not the scheduler's internal order." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `xdp/src/device.rs` -> `open_queue()` (around line 157)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a batch crafted so scheduling reorders it relative to fee priority
- Exploit idea: Submit conflicting transactions in one batch so `open_queue` produces a different commit depending on scheduling order that is not fixed by the block.
- Invariant to test: Committed state is a function of the block's transaction order, not the scheduler's internal order.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Execute the same batch under several scheduler orderings and assert one identical resulting bank hash.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
