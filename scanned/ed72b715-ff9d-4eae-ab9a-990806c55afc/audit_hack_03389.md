## Details
# Reentrancy in withdrawToken could lead to funds drained

## Summary
Function `withdrawToken` does not follow the `checks-effects-interactions` pattern, nor it is defined with the `nonReentrant` modifier, so it is susceptible to a reentrancy attack that could lead to protocol draining.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `withdrawToken`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L450-L462
performs a `safeTransferFrom` to the recipient, the `Bull`, so he can pull the NFT in case the transfer when settling the order fails:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L394-L400
If the protocol had allowed an `EIP-4524` (which is an `ERC20` with some extra functionalities, such as a `safeTransferFrom` function, which is what we'll use to show the attack vector) contract both as an `asset` and a `collection`, and had some amount of this token deposited in the contract, it could be totally drained by this reentrancy attack.
Steps:
* The bull is a contract which has a function `onERC20Received` which calls the `withdrawToken` function of `BullVBear` when the tokens are received.
* The bull is a contract which reverts when receiving the NFT (which is not an NFT, because the signature of `safeTransferFrom(address, address, uint256)` is the same in both contracts, only the last `uint256` means `tokenID` in `ERC721` but `amount` in `EIP-4524`).
* To perform the reentrancy attack, the `Bull` calls function `withdrawToken`  and when tokens are sent to him in
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L456
and before the mapping is updated
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L459
the function `onERC20Received` calls again the `withdrawToken` function of `BullVBear` until it drains all the funds from the contract.
To prevent that the call reverts, function `onERC20Received` should check the balance is enough to call again `withdrawToken`. In case it's not enough it should do nothing so the execution continues and the transaction ends.


## Impact
As the constraints needed for this attack are very unlikely to happen, and citing the `Sherlock` docs on Judging for Medium severity issues:
>There is a viable scenario (even if unlikely) that could cause the protocol to enter a state where a material amount of funds can be lost.

I think the impact for this issue is Medium, because although very unlikely to happen, there's still a chance of protocol's funds loss.

## Recommendation
Follow `checks-effects-interactions` pattern moving the transfer of the NFT:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L455-L456
after the modification of the `withdrawableCollectionTokenId` mapping.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L458-L459
Also, add the `nonReentrant` modifier to the function for extra security:
```solidity
function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public nonReentrant {
...
```
