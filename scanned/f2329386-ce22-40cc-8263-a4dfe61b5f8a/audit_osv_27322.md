# [H] OS Command Injection in MacOS Text-To-Speech Class in significant-gravitas/autogpt

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2024-1880
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2024-06-06
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2024-1880
Type: osv

## Details
An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the MacOS Text-To-Speech class MacOSTTS of the significant-gravitas/autogpt project, affecting versions up to v0.5.0. The vulnerability arises from the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the `_speech` method of the MacOSTTS class. Specifically, the use of `os.system` to execute the `say` command with user-supplied text allows for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can inject shell commands. This issue is triggered when the AutoGPT instance is run with the `--speak` option enabled and configured with `TEXT_TO_SPEECH_PROVIDER=macos`, reflecting back a shell injection snippet. The impact of this vulnerability is the potential execution of arbitrary code on the instance running AutoGPT. The issue was addressed in version 5.1.0.
