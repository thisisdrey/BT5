# [H] Flowise: Public chatflow endpoints return unsanitized flowData including plaintext API keys, passwords, and credential IDs

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-w47f-j8rh-wx87
CVE: CVE-2026-41278
CWE: CWE-200
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-04-17
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w47f-j8rh-wx87
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- npm: `flowise` — affected >=0 <3.1.0

## Details
### Summary

The `GET /api/v1/public-chatflows/:id` endpoint returns the full chatflow object **without sanitization** for public chatflows. Docker validation revealed this is worse than initially assessed: the `sanitizeFlowDataForPublicEndpoint` function does NOT exist in the released v3.0.13 Docker image. Both `public-chatflows` AND `public-chatbotConfig` return completely raw flowData including credential IDs, plaintext API keys, and password-type fields.

### Root Cause

```typescript
// packages/server/src/controllers/chatflows/index.ts:218-220
const chatflow = await chatflowsService.getChatflowById(req.params.id)
if (!chatflow) return res.status(StatusCodes.NOT_FOUND).json(...)
if (chatflow.isPublic) return res.status(StatusCodes.OK).json(chatflow) // ← NO sanitization!
```

### Docker Validation (v3.0.13)

Created public chatflow with credential IDs and passwords in flowData:
```json
{
  "flowData": "{\"nodes\":[{\"data\":{\"credential\":\"e92a39bf-...\",\"inputs\":{\"password\":\"sk-supersecretkey123\",\"apiKey\":\"should-not-leak\"}}}]}"
}
```

The `sanitizeFlowDataForPublicEndpoint` function only exists in unreleased HEAD, and even there, only `public-chatbotConfig` calls it — `public-chatflows` never does.

### Impact

- **Credential IDs** leaked — enables OAuth2 token theft chain (Finding 1)
- **Plaintext API keys and passwords** leaked — direct third-party account compromise
- **Node configurations** leaked — reveals internal architecture and endpoint URLs
- Both `public-chatflows` and `public-chatbotConfig` are affected in the released version

### Suggested Fix

Apply sanitization to both public endpoints:

```typescript
const sanitized = sanitizeFlowDataForPublicEndpoint(chatflow)
return res.status(StatusCodes.OK).json(sanitized)
```

Ensure the sanitization function strips all `credential`, `password`, `apiKey`, and `secretKey` fields from `flowData`.
