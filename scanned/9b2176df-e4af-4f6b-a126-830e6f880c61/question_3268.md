# Q3268: Handshake timeout/retry abuse in Machine.Initiate

## Question
Can an attacker use a handshake carrying an empty certificate field to keep `Machine.Initiate` (handshake/machine.go) retrying, re-sending, or holding a slot so a legitimate peer cannot complete its own handshake?

## Target
- File/function: `handshake/machine.go` -> `Machine.Initiate` (declared at handshake/machine.go:167)
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated handshake packet (`header.Handshake`) from a host holding no CA-signed certificate
- Attacker controls: a handshake carrying an empty certificate field; the attacker holds no CA-signed certificate, no host or root access, no leaked keys, and no configuration control.
- Exploit idea: Start handshakes that never complete and observe timer wheel and retry behaviour in `Machine.Initiate`.
- Invariant to test: Incomplete handshakes expire on a fixed schedule and never starve legitimate handshake capacity.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Denial of service preventing legitimate peers from establishing tunnels.
- Fast validation: Integration test with N stalled initiations plus one legitimate peer, asserting the legitimate handshake still completes.
