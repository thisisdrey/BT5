# Q0044: calc-cumulative-debt via supply-collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg reach `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it multiplies scaled principal by an index, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg varied, and assert that the value `calc-cumulative-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
