# Q5227: merkle proof verification on malformed paths — trie_store.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `query` / `call_function` view request on a public RPC node, a proof with duplicated, reordered, or over-long path elements, with a value stored directly at a full 16-way branch node, and additionally when the same value is written and deleted by many accounts in one chunk, reach `store_update` in `core/store/src/adapter/trie_store.rs` and have a forged proof verify against an honest root, breaking the invariant that merkle path verification binds length, order, and direction of every step, leading to High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/adapter/trie_store.rs` :: `store_update`
- Entrypoint: a `query` / `call_function` view request on a public RPC node
- Attacker controls: a proof with duplicated, reordered, or over-long path elements; with a value stored directly at a full 16-way branch node; when the same value is written and deleted by many accounts in one chunk
- Exploit idea: have a forged proof verify against an honest root
- Invariant to test: merkle path verification binds length, order, and direction of every step
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass
- Fast validation: unit test over malformed proof paths
