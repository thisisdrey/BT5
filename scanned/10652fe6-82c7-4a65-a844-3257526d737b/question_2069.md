# Q2069: send-underlying via liquidate-redeem: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, drive `send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) — which pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope — to convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction, breaking the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from, and cause permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
