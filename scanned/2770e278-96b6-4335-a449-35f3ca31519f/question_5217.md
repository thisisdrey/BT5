# Q5217: mask-shift-combine via collateral-add: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `mask-shift-combine` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422) — which folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half — to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422` -> `mask-shift-combine`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `mask-shift-combine` folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half. Reach it through `collateral-add` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `mask-shift-combine` touches, run `collateral-add` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
