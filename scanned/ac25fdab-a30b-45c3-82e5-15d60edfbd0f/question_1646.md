# Q1646: get-account-scaled-debt via liquidate-multi: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-account-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307) make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307` -> `get-account-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch varied, and assert that the value `get-account-scaled-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
