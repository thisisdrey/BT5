# [C] MLflow Command Injection vulnerability

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: GHSA-r23q-823p-vmf7
CVE: CVE-2025-15379
CWE: CWE-77
Ecosystem: PyPI
CVSS: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-03-30
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r23q-823p-vmf7
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- PyPI: `mlflow` — affected >=0 <3.8.1

## Details
A command injection vulnerability exists in MLflow's model serving container initialization code, specifically in the `_install_model_dependencies_to_env()` function. When deploying a model with `env_manager=LOCAL`, MLflow reads dependency specifications from the model artifact's `python_env.yaml` file and directly interpolates them into a shell command without sanitization. This allows an attacker to supply a malicious model artifact and achieve arbitrary command execution on systems that deploy the model. The vulnerability affects versions 3.8.0 and is fixed in version 3.8.1.
