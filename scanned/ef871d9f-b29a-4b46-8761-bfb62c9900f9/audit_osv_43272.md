# [M] ToolJet: Cross-tenant Broken Access Control in ToolJet Database (tooljet-db): any authenticated user can read and write another organization's tables

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-73068
Aliases: GHSA-h47x-ffhc-xqh8
CVSS: 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)

Type: osv

## Details
ToolJet is the open-source foundation am AI-native platform for building and deploying internal tools, workflows and AI agents. Prior to 3.20.207, the ToolJet Database HTTP API in server/src/modules/tooljet-db/controller.ts authorizes operations against the :organizationId URL path value without verifying that the caller belongs to that organization. JwtAuthGuard validates the tj-workspace-id header against the caller's memberships, while server/src/modules/tooljet-db/ability/index.ts grants VIEW_TABLES, VIEW_TABLE, and JOIN_TABLES without binding them to the path organization. An authenticated user can set tj-workspace-id to the user's own workspace and target another workspace through GET /api/tooljet-db/organizations/:organizationId/tables, GET /api/tooljet-db/organizations/:organizationId/table/:tableName, POST /api/tooljet-db/organizations/:organizationId/join, and the related table-management routes, allowing disclosure of table names, schemas, and rows and allowing tables to be created, altered, bulk populated, or dropped across tenant boundaries. This issue is fixed in version 3.20.207-lts.
