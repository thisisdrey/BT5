# Q2842: interpolate-rate via accrue: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, can an unprivileged attacker make `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points, so the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `accrue` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
