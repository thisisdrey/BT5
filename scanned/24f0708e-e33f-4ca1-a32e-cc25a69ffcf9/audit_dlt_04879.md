# `batchMatchOrders` won't work with ether transfers

## Summary
`batchMatchOrders` calls `matchOrder`, but the former is not market as `payable` while the latter is

## Vulnerability Detail
The `matchOrder` functionality allows users to use it with the native asset (Ether) directly, because it is marked as `payable` and has `msg.value` handling. This is not the case in the `batchMatchOrders` - it is missing the `payable` keyword, so everyone who tries to call it with `msg.value > 0` will have his transaction reverted.

## Impact
This is a protocol functionality that won't work correctly when a user is using the chain's native asset, so I rate this as Medium severity.
