# [H] CVE-2018-14619

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2018-14619
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2018-08-30
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2018-14619
Type: osv

## Details
A flaw was found in the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel before version kernel-4.15-rc4. The "null skcipher" was being dropped when each af_alg_ctx was freed instead of when the aead_tfm was freed. This can cause the null skcipher to be freed while it is still in use leading to a local user being able to crash the system or possibly escalate privileges.
