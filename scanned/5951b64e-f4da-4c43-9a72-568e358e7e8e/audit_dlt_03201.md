# Vulnerability details

## Bug Description 
The `PriceFeed` contract has sequencerUptimeFeed checks in place to assert if the sequencer on an L2 is running but these checks are not implemented correctly. The [chainlink docs ](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds)say that `sequencerUptimeFeed` can return a 0 value for `startedAt` if it is called during an "invalid round". 

![0A5A6D3A-C8EA-46CF-810C-88AA0C420803_4_5005_c](https://github.com/adeolu98/text-me-anon/assets/39372980/75166f79-13d9-457a-841b-394eae9ba468)

Please note that an **"invalid round"** is described to mean there was a problem updating the sequencer's status, possibly due to network issues or problems with data from oracles, and is shown by a `startedAt` time of 0 and `answer` is 0. Further explanation can be seen as given by an official chainlink engineer as seen here in the chainlink public discord

https://discord.com/channels/592041321326182401/605768708266131456/1213847312141525002

This makes the implemented check below in the [PriceFeed.getPrice()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/oracle/PriceFeed.sol#L63C1-L82C6) to be useless if its called in an invalid round. 

```solidity
            if (block.timestamp - startedAt <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) { 
                revert Errors.GRACE_PERIOD_NOT_OVER();
            }
```
as startedAt will be 0, the arithmetic operation block.timestamp - startedAt will result in a value greater than GRACE_PERIOD_TIME (which is hardcoded to be 3600) i.e block.timestamp = 1719739032, so 1719739032 - 0 = 1719739032 which is bigger than 3600. The code won't revert.


Imagine a case where a round starts, at the beginning `startedAt` is recorded to be 0, and  `answer`, the initial status is set to be 0. Note that docs say that if `answer` = 0, sequencer is up, if equals to 1, sequencer is down. But in this case here, `answer` and `startedAt` can be 0 initially, till after all data is gotten from oracles and update is confirmed then the values are reset to the correct values that show the correct status of the sequencer.  

From these explanations and information, it can be seen that `startedAt` value is a second value that should be used in the check for if a sequencer is down/up or correctly updated. The checks in [PriceFeed.getPrice()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-size/blob/8850e25fb088898e9cf86f9be1c401ad155bea86/src/oracle/PriceFeed.sol#L63C1-L82C6) will allow for sucessfull calls in an invalid round because reverts dont happen if answer == 0 and startedAt == 0 thus defeating the purpose of having a sequencerFeed check to assertain the status of the sequencerFeed on L2 i.e if it is up/down/active or if its status is actually confirmed to be either.

```solidity
            if (answer == 1) {
                // sequencer is down
                revert Errors.SEQUENCER_DOWN();
```
