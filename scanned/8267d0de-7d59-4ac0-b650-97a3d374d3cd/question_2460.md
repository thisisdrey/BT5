# Q2460: is-healthy via supply-collateral-add: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) reach `is-healthy` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:656) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it returns true whenever `debt-usd` is zero and otherwise compares the raw products `(* debt-usd BPS)` and `(* collateral-usd ltv)`, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:656` -> `is-healthy`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy` returns true whenever `debt-usd` is zero and otherwise compares the raw products `(* debt-usd BPS)` and `(* collateral-usd ltv)`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `is-healthy` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
