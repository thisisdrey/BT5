# Q3506: TrustedCalls delegate execution: return-data flow / safe confusion / exact whitelist semantics

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with trusted targets whose return data may influence later calls in the same transaction while the trusted call eventually reaches Loans, PortfolioVault, or LoansExchange through the Safe and make a delegate of one Safe execute a call from another Safe or another trust context, breaking the rule that trusted-call checking should bind the exact operational semantics intended, not just the first 4 bytes in isolation and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and Safe-module access control?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: trusted targets whose return data may influence later calls in the same transaction
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe execute a call from another Safe or another trust context
- Invariant to test: trusted-call checking should bind the exact operational semantics intended, not just the first 4 bytes in isolation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and Safe-module access control
- Fast validation: Model batched calls that share state and assert a revert or invalid later call cannot leave an exploitable partial effect.
