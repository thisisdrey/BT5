# Q1891: Exchange offer lifecycle: cashflow timing / stale snapshot / full unlock on cancel

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active while the offer contains multiple loans whose economic state can diverge while storage stays static and make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way, breaking the rule that cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue and leading to Loans NFT being stuck or left under a stale exchange lock?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active
- Exploit idea: make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way
- Invariant to test: cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being stuck or left under a stale exchange lock
- Fast validation: Forge test directed offers with multiple loans, expiry edges, and registration churn, then assert full delivery or full revert.
