# Q19937: Gas-Charge State Drift in dereference_mut

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker drive `aptos-move/block-executor/src/explicit_sync_wrapper.rs::dereference_mut` so gas charging, abort handling, or fee accounting diverges from the state changes that finally commit, producing theft, bypass, or stuck state?

## Target
- File/function: aptos-move/block-executor/src/explicit_sync_wrapper.rs::dereference_mut
- Entrypoint: Submit a crafted transaction or conflicting batch that reaches `dereference_mut` during scheduling, execution, re-execution, or commit.
- Attacker controls: conflicting transaction batches, gas budgets, delayed-field access patterns, package publishes, and execution ordering
- Exploit idea: Look for paths where gas or abort accounting can separate from the state transition it is supposed to meter.
- Invariant to test: Gas, abort, and state effects must stay coupled through retries, re-execution, and final commit.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Unauthorized theft, minting, burning, freezing, or reassignment of APT, fungible assets, tokenized assets, staking balances, vesting balances, or other user-controlled on-chain value through transaction validation, Move execution, native-function handling, or state-commitment failure.
- Fast validation: Force edge-case abort and retry scenarios and assert charged gas, emitted status, and final state changes remain strictly consistent.
