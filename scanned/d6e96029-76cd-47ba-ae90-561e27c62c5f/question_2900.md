# Q2900: Address-book role bit isolation: role reuse / bit confusion / exact whitelist

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with the same attacker-controlled grantee registered under several Roles values in the same book while a later `createOffer` or `acceptOffer` flow will read the investor bit from both sides' books and make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role, breaking the rule that loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: the same attacker-controlled grantee registered under several Roles values in the same book
- Exploit idea: make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role
- Invariant to test: loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules
- Fast validation: Model one self-managed book plus the canonical book and assert they can never substitute for each other.
