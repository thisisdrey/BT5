# Q1110: sync_indexer_flags: migrated or delegated authority path accepts the wrong signer [a-same-slot-sequence-that] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `sync_indexer_flags` from `sync_indexer_flags` with a same-slot sequence that changes balances and then syncs flags so a migrated, delegated, or PDA-owned account accepts the wrong authority, violating `synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly` and causing `Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `sync_indexer_flags`
- Entrypoint: `sync_indexer_flags`
- Attacker controls: a same-slot sequence that changes balances and then syncs flags
- Exploit idea: Check all alternate authorization paths for mismatched signer identity, stale authority fields, or incorrect PDA derivation assumptions. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: synchronized flags must never diverge from enforceable state in a way that unlocks or blocks value-moving paths incorrectly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: durable financial inconsistency or account freeze with real impact
- Fast validation: Model authority transfer/migration and verify that only the intended signer path can mutate or close the account at each phase. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
