# [M] Kimai: Teamlead authorization bypass in GET /api/timesheets allows reading other users' timesheet records without being teamlead of the target

## Affected
- Packagist: `kimai/kimai` — affected >=0 <2.57.0

## Details
## Summary

`GET /api/timesheets?user=<id>` (and `users[]=<id>`) returns the targeted user's timesheet records to any caller that has the `view_other_timesheet` permission, without verifying that the caller is teamlead of any team containing the target user. The per-record endpoint `GET /api/timesheets/{id}` correctly enforces this check via `TimesheetVoter`/`RolePermissionManager::checkTeamAccessTimesheet` → `checkTeamLeadAccess`, but the list endpoint only filters projects/customers by team membership and never validates `t.user`. A `ROLE_TEAMLEAD` user can therefore enumerate any user's records — including the `rate` field — as long as those records are on a project with no team scoping (Kimai's default) or on any project that shares any team (membership, not lead) with the requester.

## Details

**Root cause:** authorization mismatch between the per-record voter and the list endpoint.

### Per-record path (correct)

`src/Voter/TimesheetVoter.php:138`:
```php
if (!$this->permissionManager->checkTeamAccessTimesheet($subject, $user)) {
    return false;
}
return $this->permissionManager->hasRolePermission($user, $permission . '_other_timesheet');
```

`checkTeamLeadAccess` (RolePermissionManager.php:143-160) requires `isTeamleadOf` (not just member) one of the **target user's** teams. The unit test `testTeamleadDeniedWhenOnlyPlainMemberOfOwnerTeam` (tests/Voter/TimesheetVoterTest.php:253-269) codifies this:

> *"a TEAMLEAD role with `view_other_timesheet` must not access another user's timesheet by being a plain team member — they must be the team's teamlead."*

### List path (vulnerable)

`src/API/TimesheetController.php:97-119`:
```php
public function cgetAction(ParamFetcherInterface $paramFetcher, ..., UserRepository $userRepository): Response
{
    $query = new TimesheetQuery(false);
    $this->prepareQuery($query, $paramFetcher);
    $seeAll = false;

    if ($this->isGranted('view_other_timesheet')) {
        /** @var array<int> $users */
        $users = $paramFetcher->get('users');
        $userId = $paramFetcher->get('user');

        if ('all' === $userId) {
            $seeAll = true;
        } elseif (\is_string($userId) && $userId !== '') {
            $users[] = (int) $userId;
        }

        if (!$seeAll) {
            foreach ($userRepository->findByIds($users) as $user) {
                $query->addUser($user);   // <-- no teamlead-of-target check
            }
        }
    }
    ...
```

`config/packages/kimai.yaml:96,115` grants `TIMESHEET_OTHER` (which contains `view_other_timesheet`) to `ROLE_TEAMLEAD`, so the gate at line 103 passes for any teamlead. The `user=` / `users[]=` IDs are pushed straight into the query.

### Net effect

For any victim `bob` who:
- has at least one team that the requester `alice` is **not** teamlead of (so the voter denies per-record access), AND
- has timesheets either on a project with no team (Kimai's default), or on a project that shares any team with `alice` (membership, not lead)

`alice` is denied via `GET /api/timesheets/{id}` but receives `bob`'s records via `GET /api/timesheets?user=<bob_id>`.

Disclosed fields in the collection response include `description`, `begin`, `end`, `duration`, `billable`, `exported`, `tags`, `rate`, `internalRate`, plus project/activity/user IDs (Default/Collection serializer groups, Timesheet.php:164-173). `rate` is financial data that the per-record voter is supposed to gate via the separate `view_rate_other_timesheet` permission.

### Why other proposed mitigations don't apply
- The `view_other_timesheet` `IsGranted` on the route is the only authorization layer in the list path; ROLE_TEAMLEAD has it globally.
- `prepareQuery` only sets `currentUser`, not authorization (BaseApiController.php:68-71).
- The serializer does not filter `rate` per caller — it is a static `Default`-group property.
- Recent commit 20c7b03 "Re-usable ACL checks on teams" hardened the voter side but left the list endpoint unchanged.

*A PoC was provided, but removed for security reasons.*

## Impact

- **Authorization bypass**: a `ROLE_TEAMLEAD` (a non-admin role typically granted to multiple users in a Kimai instance) can read any other user's timesheet records
- **Financial data disclosure**: the `rate` and `internalRate` fields are returned in the collection serializer group, leaking what gets billed/costed against any user's records.
- **PII / activity disclosure**: per-entry `description`, `begin`, `end`, `duration`, `billable`, `exported`, project/activity/customer IDs, and tags are leaked, allowing reconstruction of any user's activity timeline.

# Solution

The list of requested user `TimesheetController::cgetAction()` is now guarded with the `access_user` permission.
The `access_user` permission verifies that the requesting user is allowed to see each of the requested user.
If any of the requested users may not be seen, the entire call will fail.
