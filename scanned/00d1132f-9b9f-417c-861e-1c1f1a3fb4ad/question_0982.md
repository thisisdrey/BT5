# Q0982: refcount underflow on shared trie values — trie_recording.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys, the same value written and deleted by many accounts across shards in one chunk, with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes, reach `recorded_trie_changes` in `core/store/src/trie/trie_recording.rs` and drive a refcount below zero so a live value is dropped from the store, breaking the invariant that trie value refcounts exactly match the number of referencing nodes, leading to Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/trie/trie_recording.rs` :: `recorded_trie_changes`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys
- Attacker controls: the same value written and deleted by many accounts across shards in one chunk; with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes
- Exploit idea: drive a refcount below zero so a live value is dropped from the store
- Invariant to test: trie value refcounts exactly match the number of referencing nodes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)
- Fast validation: store test asserting refcount equals a full scan after churn
