# [H] Anonymous cache poisoning via request headers in Discourse

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: BIT-discourse-2025-23023
Aliases: CVE-2025-23023, GHSA-5h4h-2f46-r3c7
Ecosystem: Bitnami
Published: 2025-02-20
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-discourse-2025-23023
Type: osv

## Affected
- Bitnami: `discourse` — affected >=0 <3.3.2

## Details
Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions an attacker can carefully craft a request with the right request headers to poison the anonymous cache (for example, the cache may have a response with missing  preloaded data). This issue only affects anonymous visitors of the site. This problem has been patched in the latest version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable anonymous cache by setting the `DISCOURSE_DISABLE_ANON_CACHE` environment variable to a non-empty value.
