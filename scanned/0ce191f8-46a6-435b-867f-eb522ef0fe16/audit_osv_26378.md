acpi: Fix suspend with Xen PV

Commit f1e525009493 ("x86/boot: Skip realmode init code when running as
Xen PV guest") missed one code path accessing real_mode_header, leading
to dereferencing NULL when suspending the system under Xen:

Fix that by adding an optional acpi callback allowing to skip setting
the wakeup address, as in the Xen PV case this will be handled by the
hypervisor anyway.
