# Q1723: recent_blockhash is not deterministic across nodes (transaction_cost.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `recent_blockhash` in `cost-model/src/transaction_cost.rs` with an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash, and make the balances captured for the pre-execution snapshot disagree with the balances committed to the bank, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `recent_blockhash` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `cost-model/src/transaction_cost.rs` -> `recent_blockhash()` (around line 120)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash
- Exploit idea: Find input to `recent_blockhash` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `recent_blockhash` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `recent_blockhash` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
