# [M] Electron: Permission Check Handler Receives Main Frame Origin Instead of Requesting Iframe Origin

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-9pf5-hg6p-4pwp
CVE: CVE-2026-70599
CWE: CWE-346
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-08-05
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9pf5-hg6p-4pwp
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- npm: `electron` — affected >=0 <39.8.7
- npm: `electron` — affected >=40.0.0-alpha.1 <40.9.0
- npm: `electron` — affected >=41.0.0-alpha.1 <41.2.0
- npm: `electron` — affected >=42.0.0-alpha.1 <42.0.0-beta.1

## Details
### Impact
For serial-port and media (camera / microphone) permission checks made from an iframe, the `requestingOrigin` passed to `session.setPermissionCheckHandler` was the top-level frame's origin rather than the requesting frame's. Origin-based handler logic could therefore grant a cross-origin iframe device access intended only for the top-level origin.

Apps are only affected if they use `setPermissionCheckHandler` with origin-based logic and embed cross-origin iframes with delegated device permissions. Apps that base the decision on `details.securityOrigin`, or that do not embed such iframes, are not affected.

### Workarounds
Check `details.securityOrigin` instead of `requestingOrigin` for these permissions, or do not delegate device permissions to untrusted iframes.

### Fixed Versions
* `42.0.0-beta.1`
* `41.2.0`
* `40.9.0`
* `39.8.7`
