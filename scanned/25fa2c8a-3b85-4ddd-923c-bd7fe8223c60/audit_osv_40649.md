# [C] osquery: Heap buffer overflow in `getProcessCurrentDirectory()` via `processes` table (Windows)

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: CVE-2026-54000
Aliases: GHSA-4r78-6hg6-33gg
CVSS: 9.0 (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)

Type: osv

## Details
osquery is a SQL powered operating system instrumentation, monitoring, and analytics framework. Prior to 5.23.1, on Windows, a local unprivileged attacker can cause a heap buffer out-of-bounds write if there is a query of the processes table targeting a maliciously crafted process, due to unchecked PEB string lengths in process command-line and current-directory reads. If exploited successfully, this could allow a potential local privilege escalation from standard user to SYSTEM. This issue is fixed in version 5.23.1.
