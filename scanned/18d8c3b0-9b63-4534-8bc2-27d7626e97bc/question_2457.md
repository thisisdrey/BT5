# Q2457: Vault async redeem flow: partial withdraw / free asset edge / proportional reserve

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption while the manager approves only part of the pending shares before later approvals and make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side, breaking the rule that claimableRedeemShares[controller] and claimableRedeemAssets[controller] should decay proportionally to each claim and leading to Accounting issue in the vault leading to underreserved claimable redemptions?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption
- Exploit idea: make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side
- Invariant to test: claimableRedeemShares[controller] and claimableRedeemAssets[controller] should decay proportionally to each claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in the vault leading to underreserved claimable redemptions
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated redeem()/withdraw() calls against partially approved redemptions and assert reserve counters stay exact.
