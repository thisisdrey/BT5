# Q3935: Smart account deployment and initialization: duplicate entries / foreign context configure / initializer fidelity

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays while a second configuration attempt is made against a Safe that already ran initialization once and make an attacker use the factory's configuration logic to alter a Safe or Safe-like context it should not own, breaking the rule that duplicate or crafted array inputs should not silently widen module delegates or spending surface beyond the explicit initializer semantics and leading to Cross-user confusion about who controls a newly deployed operational account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays
- Exploit idea: make an attacker use the factory's configuration logic to alter a Safe or Safe-like context it should not own
- Invariant to test: duplicate or crafted array inputs should not silently widen module delegates or spending surface beyond the explicit initializer semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user confusion about who controls a newly deployed operational account
- Fast validation: Check that no foreign Safe or Safe-like contract can abuse the factory's delegatecall-based initializer to install new module state.
