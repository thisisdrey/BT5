# Q0145: linear-interpolate via borrow: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `amount`, drive `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) — which interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)` — to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, breaking the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `borrow` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with `amount`, then read `linear-interpolate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
