# Q3410: receive-underlying via collateral-remove-redeem: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account, so the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `receiver` for the underlying leg varied, and assert that the value `receive-underlying` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
