# Q5149: vault-system-repay via repay: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, drive `vault-system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207) — which routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id — to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, breaking the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207` -> `vault-system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, then read `vault-system-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
