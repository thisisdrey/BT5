# Q1540: get-position via borrow: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the future mask produced by the new debt bit reach `get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `borrow` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
