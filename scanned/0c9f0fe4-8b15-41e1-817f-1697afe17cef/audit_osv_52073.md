# [H] CVE-2021-47040

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2021-47040
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2024-02-28
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2021-47040
Type: osv

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix overflows checks in provide buffers

Colin reported before possible overflow and sign extension problems in
io_provide_buffers_prep(). As Linus pointed out previous attempt did nothing
useful, see d81269fecb8ce ("io_uring: fix provide_buffers sign extension").

Do that with help of check_<op>_overflow helpers. And fix struct
io_provide_buf::len type, as it doesn't make much sense to keep it
signed.
