# Q2453: Vault async redeem flow: partial withdraw / dust strand / proportional reserve

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption while the manager approves only part of the pending shares before later approvals and strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be withdrawn or cancelled, breaking the rule that claimableRedeemShares[controller] and claimableRedeemAssets[controller] should decay proportionally to each claim and leading to User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption
- Exploit idea: strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be withdrawn or cancelled
- Invariant to test: claimableRedeemShares[controller] and claimableRedeemAssets[controller] should decay proportionally to each claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Model a tight-liquidity approval followed by partial claims and assert no controller can extract more than the burned shares justified.
