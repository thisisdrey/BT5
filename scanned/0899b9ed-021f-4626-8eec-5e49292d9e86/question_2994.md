# Q2994: calc-liq-factor-bound via liquidate-multi: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the full batch list and its ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liq-factor-bound` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `calc-liq-factor-bound` scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max, so the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718` -> `calc-liq-factor-bound`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-bound` scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-factor-bound` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
