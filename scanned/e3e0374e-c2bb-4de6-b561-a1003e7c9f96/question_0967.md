# Q0967: insert via collateral-remove: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), then read `insert` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
