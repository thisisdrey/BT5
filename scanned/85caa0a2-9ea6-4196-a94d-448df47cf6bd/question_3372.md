# Q3372: TrustedCalls delegate execution: batch order / partial-state batch / no cross-safe bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with the order of several batched trusted calls that share state across the same Safe or target while another Safe in the system has different delegates or target trust expectations and make a batch preserve side effects from earlier calls even though a later call should invalidate the whole operational intent, breaking the rule that a delegate or batch context should never bleed authority across Safe boundaries and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of value from another Safe or user context?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: the order of several batched trusted calls that share state across the same Safe or target
- Exploit idea: make a batch preserve side effects from earlier calls even though a later call should invalidate the whole operational intent
- Invariant to test: a delegate or batch context should never bleed authority across Safe boundaries
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of value from another Safe or user context
- Fast validation: Check that a delegate of one Safe cannot drive Loans, Vault, or Exchange state as if acting for another Safe.
