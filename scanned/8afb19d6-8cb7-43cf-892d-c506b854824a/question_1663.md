# Q1663: Exchange offer lifecycle: seller inputs / bundle inconsistency / full unlock on cancel

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline while one side is a vault or later counterparty that relies on precise lock cleanup and delivery semantics and make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert, breaking the rule that cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue and leading to Loans NFT being stuck or left under a stale exchange lock?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline
- Exploit idea: make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert
- Invariant to test: cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being stuck or left under a stale exchange lock
- Fast validation: Model cashflow accrual during an active offer and assert settlement cannot mix old storage with new economic state improperly.
