# Q0596: is-healthy via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `is-healthy` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:656) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it returns true whenever `debt-usd` is zero and otherwise compares the raw products `(* debt-usd BPS)` and `(* collateral-usd ltv)`, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:656` -> `is-healthy`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy` returns true whenever `debt-usd` is zero and otherwise compares the raw products `(* debt-usd BPS)` and `(* collateral-usd ltv)`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption varied, and assert that the value `is-healthy` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
