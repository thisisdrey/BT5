# Q2836: Error message / timing oracle in ConnectionState.Curve

## Question
Do the distinct failure paths in `ConnectionState.Curve` (connection_state.go) for a burst of handshakes from one source address reveal, by timing or observable response, whether a given identity or index exists on the node?

## Target
- File/function: `connection_state.go` -> `ConnectionState.Curve` (declared at connection_state.go:84)
- Entrypoint: Unauthenticated handshake packet (`header.Handshake`) from a host holding no CA-signed certificate
- Attacker controls: a burst of handshakes from one source address; the attacker holds no CA-signed certificate, no host or root access, no leaked keys, and no configuration control.
- Exploit idea: Compare responses/latency for a valid-but-unauthorized versus a nonexistent identity.
- Invariant to test: Handshake rejection is indistinguishable across failure causes from the network.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Information disclosure enabling targeted attacks against specific overlay hosts.
- Fast validation: Timing test over many trials asserting the two failure paths in `ConnectionState.Curve` are statistically indistinguishable.
