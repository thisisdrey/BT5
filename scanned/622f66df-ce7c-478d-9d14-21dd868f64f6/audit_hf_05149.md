## Details
When a user votes for collection shutdown, the CollectionShutdown contract gathers the whole balance from the user. However, when cancelling the shutdown process, the contract doesn't refund the user's votes.
The function gathers the whole balance of the collection token from a voter.
```solidity
function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params)
    internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
    ,→
    uint userVotes = params.collectionToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (userVotes == 0) revert UserHoldsNoTokens();
    // Pull our tokens in from the user
    params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);
}
```
But in the function, it does not refund the voters tokens.
```solidity
function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
    // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
    CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();
    // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
    // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
    // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
    ,→
    if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 **
        locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
        ,→
        revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
    }
    // Remove our execution flag
    delete _collectionParams[_collection];
    emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
}
```
Shutdown Voters will be ended up losing their whole collection tokens by cancelling the shutdown.

## Proof of Concept
Here is the testcase of the POC:
To bypass the total supply vs shutdown votes restriction, added the following line to the test case:
```solidity
collectionToken.mint(address(10), _additionalAmount);
```
The whole test case is:
```solidity
function test_CancelShutdownNotRefund() public withQuorumCollection {
    uint256 _additionalAmount = 1 ether;
    // Confirm that we can execute with our quorum-ed collection
    assertCanExecute(address(erc721b), true);
    vm.prank(address(locker));
    collectionToken.mint(address(10), _additionalAmount);
    // Cancel our shutdown
    collectionShutdown.cancel(address(erc721b));
    // Now that we have cancelled the shutdown process, we should no longer
    // be able to execute the shutdown.
    assertCanExecute(address(erc721b), false);
    console.log("Address 1 balance after:", collectionToken.balanceOf(address(1)));
    console.log("Address 2 balance after:", collectionToken.balanceOf(address(2)));
}
```
Here are the logs after running the test:
```bash

As can be seen from the logs, the voters(1, 2) were not refunded their tokens.

## Recommendation
1. Add new state variable to the contract that records all voters
```solidity
address[] public votersList;
```
2. Update the _vote() function like below:
```solidity
function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params)
    internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
    ,→
    // Register the amount of votes sent as a whole, and store them against the user
    ,→
    params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);
    // Register the amount of votes for the collection against the user
    +
    if (shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender] == 0)
    +
        votersList.push(msg.sender);
    unchecked { shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender] += userVotes; }
}
```
3. Add the new code section to the reclaimVote() function, that removes the sender from the votersList.
4. Update the cancel() function like below:
```solidity
function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
    if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 **
        locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
        ,→
        revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
    }
    +
    uint256 i;
    +
    uint256 votersLength = votersList.length;
    +
    for (; i < votersLength; i ++) {
    +
        params.collectionToken.transfer(
    +
            votersList[i],
    +
            shutdownVoters[_collection][votersList[i]]
    +
        );
    +
    }
    // Remove our execution flag
    delete _collectionParams[_collection];
    +
    delete votersList;
    emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
}
```
After running the testcase on the above update, the user voters are able to get their own votes:
```bash
$ forge test --match-test test_CancelShutdownNotRefund -vv
