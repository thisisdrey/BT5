# Q2977: unload_program_entry can be driven into unbounded work (loaded_programs.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `unload_program_entry` in `program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs` with a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing, and make `unload_program_entry` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `unload_program_entry` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs` -> `unload_program_entry()` (around line 945)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `unload_program_entry` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `unload_program_entry` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `unload_program_entry` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged remote client can send TPU/QUIC traffic or transaction packets that panic, deadlock, or unboundedly grow memory in ingress, sigverify, scheduling, or PoH, halting block production across the cluster.
