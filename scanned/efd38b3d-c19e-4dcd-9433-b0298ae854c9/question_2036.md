# Q2036: Vault async deposit flow: operator timing / ratio drift / no stranded claim

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with an operator approval added and removed around request and claim boundaries while a holdings or ledger change zeroes `lastNavUpdate` between request and the next approval cycle and make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable approved value and leading to Cross-shareholder dilution through broken async deposit accounting?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: an operator approval added and removed around request and claim boundaries
- Exploit idea: make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable approved value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-shareholder dilution through broken async deposit accounting
- Fast validation: Inject an approval after a NAV invalidation cycle and assert the final claim never exceeds the exact approval-time price lock.
