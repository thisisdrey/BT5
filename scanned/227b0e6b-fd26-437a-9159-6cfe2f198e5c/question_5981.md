# Q5981: linear-interpolate via repay: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) — which interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)` — to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, breaking the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `repay` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `ft` trait principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
