# Q5513: resolve-interpolation-points via redeem: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling `recipient`, drive `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) — which selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization — to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `redeem` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `recipient`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
