# Q3450: relevant via liquidate: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `min-collateral-expected`, can an unprivileged attacker make `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask, so the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `liquidate` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-collateral-expected` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `relevant` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
