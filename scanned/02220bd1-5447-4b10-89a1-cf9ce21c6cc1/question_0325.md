# Q0325: unpack-u16 via liquidate-multi: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) — which unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word — to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, breaking the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, then read `unpack-u16` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
