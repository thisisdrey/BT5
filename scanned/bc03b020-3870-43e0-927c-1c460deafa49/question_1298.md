# Q1298: Loan NFT lock and nonce state: per-token approval / nonce miss / epoch cleanliness

## Question
Can an unprivileged current owner, approved address, buyer, or seller using ordinary NFT actions enter through `LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom` with a normal per-token approval rather than a global operator approval while the token is currently locked to a non-zero unlocker and make an ownership-set change fail to produce the nonce signal a downstream contract expects, breaking the rule that lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward and leading to Unintended or unfair reassignment of loan cashflow rights?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansNFT.sol / lock, unlock, _update
- Entrypoint: LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom
- Attacker controls: a normal per-token approval rather than a global operator approval
- Exploit idea: make an ownership-set change fail to produce the nonce signal a downstream contract expects
- Invariant to test: lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair reassignment of loan cashflow rights
- Fast validation: Forge test per-token approvals, lock/unlock cycles, and transfers, then assert nonce, owner, and unlocker views stay in one epoch.
