# Q3439: new_scheduler_id can be driven into unbounded work (lib.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `new_scheduler_id` in `unified-scheduler-pool/src/lib.rs` with a batch crafted so scheduling reorders it relative to fee priority, and make `new_scheduler_id` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `new_scheduler_id` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `unified-scheduler-pool/src/lib.rs` -> `new_scheduler_id()` (around line 377)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a batch crafted so scheduling reorders it relative to fee priority
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `new_scheduler_id` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `new_scheduler_id` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `new_scheduler_id` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged remote client can send TPU/QUIC traffic or transaction packets that panic, deadlock, or unboundedly grow memory in ingress, sigverify, scheduling, or PoH, halting block production across the cluster.
