# [H] CVE-2021-47633

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2021-47633
CVSS: 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2025-02-26

Type: osv

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ath5k: fix OOB in ath5k_eeprom_read_pcal_info_5111

The bug was found during fuzzing. Stacktrace locates it in
ath5k_eeprom_convert_pcal_info_5111.
When none of the curve is selected in the loop, idx can go
up to AR5K_EEPROM_N_PD_CURVES. The line makes pd out of bound.
pd = &chinfo[pier].pd_curves[idx];

There are many OOB writes using pd later in the code. So I
added a sanity check for idx. Checks for other loops involving
AR5K_EEPROM_N_PD_CURVES are not needed as the loop index is not
used outside the loops.

The patch is NOT tested with real device.

The following is the fuzzing report
