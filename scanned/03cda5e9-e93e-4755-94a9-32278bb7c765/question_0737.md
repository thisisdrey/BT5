# Q0737: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: tiny-large mix / clearing mismatch / same-loan cash

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with alternating tiny and large payment amounts before any servicing batch runs while an investor or vault cashflow collection could run soon after the borrower payment and make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes, breaking the rule that `pay` should only increase `ACC_CASH` and `ACC_BORROWER_PAYMENT_CLEARING` for the same loan and never leak across loans and leading to Cross-user exploit window against NAV-sensitive vault operations?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: alternating tiny and large payment amounts before any servicing batch runs
- Exploit idea: make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes
- Invariant to test: `pay` should only increase `ACC_CASH` and `ACC_BORROWER_PAYMENT_CLEARING` for the same loan and never leak across loans
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user exploit window against NAV-sensitive vault operations
- Fast validation: Model a vault-held loan, have the borrower pay just before NAV-sensitive approvals, and assert no stale-price claim becomes possible.
