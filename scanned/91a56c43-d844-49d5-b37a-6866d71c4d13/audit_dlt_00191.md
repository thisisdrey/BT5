# [M] OpenZeppelin Contracts vulnerable to Improper Escaping of Output

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Chain: Solidity
Component: @openzeppelin/contracts
CVE: CVE-2023-40014
CWE: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
Published: 2023-08-11
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g4vp-m682-qqmp
Type: github-advisory

## Details
### Impact

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in v4.9.3.
