# Q2412: zip via redeem: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `redeem` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `zip` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
