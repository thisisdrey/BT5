# Vulnerability details

## Impact
Some ERC20 tokens implemented so a fee is taken when transferring them, for example `STA` and `PAXG`. The current implementation of the `VotingEscrow` contract will mess up the accounting of the locked amounts if `token` will be a token like that, what will lead to a state where users won't be able to receive their funds.

This will happen because the value that is added to the locked amount is not the actual value received by the contract, but the value supplied by the user (the value which the fee is taken from).

## Proof of Concept
The `STA` token burns 1% of the value provided to the `transfer` function, which means the recipient gets only 99% of the transferred asset. Let's assume that `token` is the address of the `STA` token.
1. Bob wants to lock 100 STA tokens and calls `createLock(100 * 10**18, unlockTime)`.
2. The addition to the locked amount variable is done with `100 * 10**18`, while the actual amount that was received by the contract is `99 * 10**18`.
3. When the lock expires Bob will try to withdraw his tokens, and the transfer function will be called with the accounted locked amount (which is `100 * 10**18`). This might succeed due to other users locking too, so the transferred tokens will be taken from "their tokens", but in the end there will be users left without an option to withdraw their funds, because the balance of the contract will be less than the locked amount that the contract is trying to transfer.

## Tools Used
Manual auditing - VS Code and me :)

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Calculate the amount to add to the locked amount by the difference between the balances before and after the transfer instead of using the supplied value.
