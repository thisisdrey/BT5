# Q3086: mask-update via collateral-remove-redeem: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `mask-update` sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero, so the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94` -> `mask-update`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `mask-update` sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) varied, and assert that the value `mask-update` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
