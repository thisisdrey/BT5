# Q1004: Investor withdrawal routing: duplicate ids / batch bleed / no stale unlocker

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with duplicate, reordered, or adversarially mixed loan ids in the batch while a sale offer was recently accepted or cancelled before the batch executes and make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it, breaking the rule that a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: duplicate, reordered, or adversarially mixed loan ids in the batch
- Exploit idea: make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it
- Invariant to test: a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale
- Fast validation: Model sale-offer settlement or cancellation around `investorWithdraw` and assert no stale unlocker or stale owner can claim old payables.
