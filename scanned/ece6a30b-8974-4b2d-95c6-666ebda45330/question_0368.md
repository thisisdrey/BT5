# Q0368: Loans funding and disbursement state: standing allowance / epoch confusion / same-loan accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing while the NFT has been approved, listed, cancelled, or transferred shortly before the funding call and make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions, breaking the rule that funding or disbursing one loan should never create withdrawable or priceable balances attributable to another loan or investor and leading to Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing
- Exploit idea: make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions
- Invariant to test: funding or disbursing one loan should never create withdrawable or priceable balances attributable to another loan or investor
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC
- Fast validation: Forge test ownership changes, lock cycles, and standing allowances around `fund`, then assert only the current NFT owner can move capital exactly once.
