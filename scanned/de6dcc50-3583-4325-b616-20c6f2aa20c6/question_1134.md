# Q1134: oracle-price-legal via collateral-remove: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `oracle-price-legal` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
