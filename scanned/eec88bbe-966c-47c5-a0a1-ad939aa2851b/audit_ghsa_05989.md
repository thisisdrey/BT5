## Advisory FAQ

### <a name="how-affected"></a>How do I know if I am affected?

If using a package listed in [affected packages](#affected-packages), an application is exposed to the vulnerability.

### <a name="how-fix"></a>How do I fix the issue?

1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET. If users have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt them to update Visual Studio, which will also update their .NET SDKs.
2. If a user's application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version. Users can list the versions they have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command.

Once a user has installed the updated runtime or SDK, they should restart their apps for the update to take effect.

Additionally, if they've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.
