# [H] Rank and multiplier of a user can not be set if the user is registered for MetaIDO by the admin

## Summary
Severity: High
Contest weight: 0.1571
Dataset id: 9030

## Details
IDOPoolAbstract::adminAddRegForMetaIDO() sets metaIDO.isRegistered[user] = true;, but not the rank and multiplier. In IDOPoolAbstract::registerForMetaIDO() it reverts if the user is already registered require(!metaIDO.isRegistered[msg.sender], "User already registered");. Thus, it will be impossible to set the rank or multiplier for users registered by the admin.
Additionally, there is unreachable code, if (metaIDO.isRegistered[msg.sender]) is always false due to the check above requiring the user to not have been registered previously.

## Recommendation
There are a few solutions, for example, when manually registering a user by the admin, the rank and multiplier can be fetched from the multiplier contract.
