# Q4536: next-index via borrow: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `borrow` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `next-index` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
