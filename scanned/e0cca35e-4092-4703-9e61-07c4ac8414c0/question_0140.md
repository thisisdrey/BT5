# Q0140: debt-remove-scaled via supply-collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against varied, and assert that the value `debt-remove-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
