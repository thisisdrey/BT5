# Q1040: find-debt-scaled via collateral-remove: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `find-debt-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
