# Q3145: mask-to-list-internal via collateral-remove-redeem: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, drive `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) — which expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries — to make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist, breaking the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, then read `mask-to-list-internal` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
