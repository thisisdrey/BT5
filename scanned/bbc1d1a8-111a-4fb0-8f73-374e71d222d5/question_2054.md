# Q2054: Vault async deposit flow: multi-request / dust strand / pending sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with multiple pending deposit requests for the same controller before any claim while the manager approves while `lastNav` is fresh and non-zero and strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be claimed or cancelled, breaking the rule that totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess vault-share minting?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: multiple pending deposit requests for the same controller before any claim
- Exploit idea: strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be claimed or cancelled
- Invariant to test: totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess vault-share minting
- Fast validation: Forge test two requests plus multiple partial approvals, then claim in alternating asset and share units and assert counter conservation.
