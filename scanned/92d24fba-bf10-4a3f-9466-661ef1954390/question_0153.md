# Q0153: Loans create authorization: role overlap / role confusion / canonical gate

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with the same attacker-controlled address reused across multiple loan roles while the attacker has only self-registered role bits in its own address book and no canonical approvals and reuse one role approval context to satisfy a different role check and initialize a loan with unauthorized parties, breaking the rule that only the canonical `address(this)` originator book should authorize loan creation and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution once the unauthorized loan enters normal funding and withdrawal flows?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: the same attacker-controlled address reused across multiple loan roles
- Exploit idea: reuse one role approval context to satisfy a different role check and initialize a loan with unauthorized parties
- Invariant to test: only the canonical `address(this)` originator book should authorize loan creation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution once the unauthorized loan enters normal funding and withdrawal flows
- Fast validation: Fuzz `msg.sender`, the `originator` parameter, and address-book contents, then assert every successful create binds to a canonically approved originator only.
