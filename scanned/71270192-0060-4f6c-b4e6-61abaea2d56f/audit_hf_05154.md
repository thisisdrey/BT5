## Details
Since liquidated listings are created without the original owner paying taxes, the lack of a check for the liquidation status means the system might incorrectly process a tax refund for a listing that was liquidated, allowing the original owner to receive funds they should not be entitled to
Liquidated listings are created without the original owner paying taxes. If the system lacks a check for liquidation status, it might process a tax refund incorrectly, The absence of a liquidation status check can lead to the original owner receiving tax refunds for liquidated listings, which they are not entitled to. This creates an opportunity for the owner to receive funds improperly
The problem arises because the relist function does not check if the Listing being relisted was from a liquidation or not, therefore causing the ”relister” to pay taxes and the contract depositing refunds to the ”liquidated user” who did not pay taxes.
Without checking liquidation status, the system may wrongly process tax refunds for liquidated listings, allowing the original owner to receive undeserved funds. This error could result in a loss of funds within the protocol.

```solidity
function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public
nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
    // Load our tokenId
    address _collection = _listing.collection;
    uint _tokenId = _listing.tokenIds[0];
    // Read the existing listing in a single read
    Listing memory oldListing = _listings[_collection][_tokenId];
    // Ensure the caller is not the owner of the listing
    if (oldListing.owner == msg.sender) revert CallerIsAlreadyOwner();
    // Load our new Listing into memory
    Listing memory listing = _listing.listing;
    // Ensure that the existing listing is available
    (bool isAvailable, uint listingPrice) = getListingPrice(_collection, _tokenId);
    if (!isAvailable) revert ListingNotAvailable();
    // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing
    (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
    if (_fees != 0) {
        emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
    }
    // Find the underlying {CollectionToken} attached to our collection
    ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
    // If the floor multiple of the original listings is different, then this needs
    // to be paid to the original owner of the listing.
    uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();
    if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
        unchecked {
            collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice -
            listingFloorPrice);
        }
    }
    // Validate our new listing
    _validateCreateListing(_listing);
    // Store our listing into our Listing mappings
    _listings[_collection][_tokenId] = listing;
    // Pay our required taxes
    payTaxWithEscrow(address(collectionToken), getListingTaxRequired(listing,
    _collection), _payTaxWithEscrow);
    // Emit events
    emit ListingRelisted(_collection, _tokenId, listing);
}
```

## Recommendation
Add a check inside the relist Function to prevent taxes being paid for listings that were liquidated
```solidity
// We can process a tax refund for the existing listing
if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
    (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
    if (_fees != 0) {
        emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
    }
} else {
    delete _isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId];
}
```
