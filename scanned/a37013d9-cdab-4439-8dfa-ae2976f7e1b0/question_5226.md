# Q5226: mask-pos via supply-collateral-add: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-pos` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91` -> `mask-pos`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `mask-pos` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
