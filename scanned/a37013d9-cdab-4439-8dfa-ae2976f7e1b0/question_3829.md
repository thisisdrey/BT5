# Q3829: next-index via liquidate-multi: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, drive `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) — which returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting — to make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist, breaking the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, then read `next-index` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
