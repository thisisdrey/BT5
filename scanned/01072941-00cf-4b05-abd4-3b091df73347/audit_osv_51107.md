# [H] CVE-2021-20322

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2021-20322
CVSS: 7.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)
Published: 2022-02-18
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2021-20322
Type: osv

## Details
A flaw in the processing of received ICMP errors (ICMP fragment needed and ICMP redirect) in the Linux kernel functionality was found to allow the ability to quickly scan open UDP ports. This flaw allows an off-path remote user to effectively bypass the source port UDP randomization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and possibly integrity, because software that relies on UDP source port randomization are indirectly affected as well.
