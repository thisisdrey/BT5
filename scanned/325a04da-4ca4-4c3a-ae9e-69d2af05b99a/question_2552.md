# Q2552: check_num_bpf_loader_accounts accepts input it should reject (parse_bpf_loader.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `check_num_bpf_loader_accounts` in `transaction-status/src/parse_bpf_loader.rs` with input that makes the check pass on a value it later stops using, and have `check_num_bpf_loader_accounts` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`check_num_bpf_loader_accounts` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-status/src/parse_bpf_loader.rs` -> `check_num_bpf_loader_accounts()` (around line 193)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: input that makes the check pass on a value it later stops using
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `check_num_bpf_loader_accounts` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `check_num_bpf_loader_accounts` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `check_num_bpf_loader_accounts` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
