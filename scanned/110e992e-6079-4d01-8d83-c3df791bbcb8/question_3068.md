# Q3068: calculate-asset-notional-value via collateral-add: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) reach `calculate-asset-notional-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold, the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544` -> `calculate-asset-notional-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Reach it through `collateral-add` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) varied, and assert that the value `calculate-asset-notional-value` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
