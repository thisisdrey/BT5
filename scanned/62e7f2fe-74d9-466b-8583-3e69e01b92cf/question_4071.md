# Q4071: oracle-price-legal via collateral-remove: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `oracle-price-legal` touches, run `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
