# Q2446: iterator/registers interaction after state mutation — dependencies.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys, a storage iterator advanced while the same subtree is being written, with the input length at exactly the host function's accepted maximum, reach `append_action_deterministic_state_init` in `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/logic/dependencies.rs` and read stale or corrupted entries, or diverge from the same sequence during replay, breaking the invariant that iteration over mutated state is deterministic and consistent with the committed trie, leading to Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/logic/dependencies.rs` :: `append_action_deterministic_state_init`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys
- Attacker controls: a storage iterator advanced while the same subtree is being written; with the input length at exactly the host function's accepted maximum
- Exploit idea: read stale or corrupted entries, or diverge from the same sequence during replay
- Invariant to test: iteration over mutated state is deterministic and consistent with the committed trie
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork
- Fast validation: differential test iterating while writing the same prefix
