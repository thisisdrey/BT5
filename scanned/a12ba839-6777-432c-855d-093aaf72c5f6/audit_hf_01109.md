## Details
There have been some changes made to the deposit flow with the intention of supporting fee-on-transfer tokens. While deposit requests record the correct transferredAmount when moving funds into the escrow contract and notifying the Centrifuge chain of the increased investment. Upon token redemption, tokens are transferred to a user escrow contract first before processing the redemption when the Centrifuge chain has successfully finalized the intent to exit out of a liquidity pool.  
```solidity
function requestDeposit(address liquidityPool, uint256 currencyAmount, address user) public auth {
    // ...
    // Transfer the currency amount from user to escrow (lock currency in escrow)
    // Checks actual balance difference to support fee-on-transfer tokens
    uint256 preBalance = ERC20Like(currency).balanceOf(address(escrow));
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(currency, user, address(escrow), _currencyAmount);
    uint256 postBalance = ERC20Like(currency).balanceOf(address(escrow));
    uint128 transferredAmount = (postBalance - preBalance).toUint128();
    InvestmentState storage state = investments[liquidityPool][user];
    state.remainingDepositRequest = state.remainingDepositRequest + transferredAmount;
    state.exists = true;
    gateway.increaseInvestOrder(
        poolId, lPool.trancheId(), user, poolManager.currencyAddressToId(currency), transferredAmount
    );
}
```
The accounting in the user escrow contract records the full currencyPayout when handling the finalized redemption message. However, the actual amount that is meant to be recorded should be currencyPayout less the fee for transferring between the escrow and user escrow contracts. Ultimately, the fee will be paid out by the last users to withdraw from the user escrow contract.

## Recommendation
Correct the accounting issue in UserEscrow or consider removing fee-on-transfer tokens altogether. The complexity that atypical ERC20 tokens introduce are exacerbated by multi-chain protocol environments. So the latter proposed change is preferred as the safest approach.
