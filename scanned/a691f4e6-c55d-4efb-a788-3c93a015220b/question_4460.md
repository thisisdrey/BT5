# Q4460: imt - state_init (NEP-616) deployment changes the callee identity (5)

## Question
Given the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_on_transfer` / `nft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` from a token contract the attacker wrote, use the `state_init` field reached through `ImtMint` in `contracts/defuse/core/src/intents/imt.rs` to deploy code at the deterministic account id right before the call, so the contract that receives `on_auth`/`mt_on_transfer` is not the one the signer expected, breaking the invariant `the code executing at the `state_init` target == the code the derived `AccountId` commits to` and leading to direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/core/src/intents/imt.rs](contracts/defuse/core/src/intents/imt.rs) - `ImtMint` (cross-check `ImtBurn` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_on_transfer` / `nft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` from a token contract the attacker wrote
- Attacker controls: `sender_id`, `amount`, the `msg` (receiver, notify, or nested intents), and the token's own behaviour
- Exploit idea: The derived id commits to the global contract id plus initial storage; probe whether the same id can be reached with different code, or whether an existing account is silently reused. Set-up: the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value.
- Invariant to test: the code executing at the `state_init` target == the code the derived `AccountId` commits to
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation
- Fast validation: Derive an id, deploy independently, then send a `state_init` call; assert the pre-existing code is not silently used.
