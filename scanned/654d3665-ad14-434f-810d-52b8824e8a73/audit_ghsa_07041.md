# [M] YesWiki Vulnerable to Reflected XSS via Unescaped `id` Parameter in Bazar Widget HTML Attributes

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-r5xw-gcgw-hwp5
CVE: CVE-2026-52774
CWE: CWE-80
Ecosystem: Packagist
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-07-09

Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Packagist: `yeswiki/yeswiki` — affected >=0 <4.6.6

## Details
### Summary
YesWiki's Bazar widget handler reflects the `id` `GET` parameter into HTML attributes using `strip_tags()` only. Because `strip_tags()` does not escape double quotes, an attacker can break out of the attribute value, inject an event handler such as `onmouseover`, and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.

This issue is reachable without authentication. During validation, the vulnerable `widget` route returned the injected HTML for both `/HomePage/widget?id=...` and `/NoSuchPage/widget?id=...`, which shows that no login, no page ownership, no edit rights, and not even a valid page tag were required. The only routing prerequisite observed was that the Bazar extension is enabled and the request includes an `id` parameter.

### Details
The primary sink is in `tools/bazar/presentation/templates/widget.tpl.html` around lines `4-7`, where `$_GET['id']` is inserted into the `data-formid` attribute:

```php
data-formid="<?php echo strip_tags($_GET['id']); ?>"
```

`strip_tags()` is not an output-encoding function. It removes HTML tags, but it does not escape characters such as double quotes, so an attacker can terminate the `data-formid` attribute and inject new attacker-controlled attributes.

The route is served by `tools/bazar/handlers/__WidgetHandler.php` around lines `14-26`, which only checks whether `$_GET['id']` is present:

```php
if (!isset($_GET['id'])) {
    return null;
}
```

No `HasAccess('read')`, `HasAccess('write')`, or authentication check is performed before the vulnerable template is rendered.

There is also a second reflection path in the same handler. The handler builds:

```php
$urlParams = 'id=' . strip_tags($_GET['id']) . ...
```

and then places the resulting value into the widget template's `data-iframeUrl` attribute:

```php
data-iframeUrl="<?php echo $GLOBALS['wiki']->href('bazariframe', '', $urlparams, false); ?>"
```

During validation, a single payload injected into `id` was reflected into both `data-formid` and `data-iframeUrl`, which confirms that the handler exposes multiple attribute-level sinks from the same unsafely handled input.

This issue maps to **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**.

### PoC
1. Set up a vulnerable YesWiki instance with the bundled Bazar extension enabled. This was validated locally on the official `doryphore 4.6.5` release.
2. Confirm the minimum access requirements:
   - No account is required.
   - No `read` or `write` permission on a specific page is required.
   - No valid existing page tag is required.
   - No valid Bazar form identifier is required.
   - The only observed requirements were that the Bazar widget handler is present and the request includes an `id` parameter.
3. Request the widget handler with an attribute-breaking payload in `id`, for example:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8085/NoSuchPage/widget?id=%22%20onmouseover=%22alert(1)%22%20x=%22
```

4. Open the URL in a browser as an unauthenticated visitor.
5. Observe that the server returns HTTP `200` and renders the Bazar widget page even though the page tag is arbitrary.
6. Inspect the returned HTML. The response contains attacker-controlled attributes in the widget root element:

```html
<div id="widgetapp" v-cloak
  data-formid="" onmouseover="alert(1)" x=""
  ...
  data-iframeUrl="http://127.0.0.1:8085/NoSuchPage/bazariframe&id=" onmouseover="alert(1)" x=""
>
```

7. Move the mouse over the `widgetapp` element or otherwise trigger the injected event handler.
8. The browser executes the injected JavaScript in the YesWiki origin.

### Impact
This is a **reflected XSS** vulnerability in the Bazar widget handler with very low attacker prerequisites.

The practical access model is:

- The attacker only needs to send a crafted public URL.
- The victim does not need to authenticate.
- The attacker does not need edit rights, ownership, or a valid page tag.
- The route only needs to be reachable on a YesWiki instance with Bazar enabled.

An attacker may be able to:

- Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
- Steal browser-accessible sensitive data.
- Perform actions in the victim's session if the victim is logged in.
- Target public visitors and authenticated users alike because the route is reachable without access-control checks.
