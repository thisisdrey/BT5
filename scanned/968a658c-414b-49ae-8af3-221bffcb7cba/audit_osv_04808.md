# [H] Envoy Lua filter use-after-free when oversized rewritten response body causes crash

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: BIT-envoy-2025-62504
Aliases: CVE-2025-62504, GHSA-gcxr-6vrp-wff3
Ecosystem: Bitnami
Published: 2025-10-21
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-envoy-2025-62504
Type: osv

## Affected
- Bitnami: `envoy` — affected >=1.36.0 <1.36.2

## Details
Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy. Envoy versions earlier than 1.36.2, 1.35.6, 1.34.10, and 1.33.12 contain a use-after-free vulnerability in the Lua filter. When a Lua script executing in the response phase rewrites a response body so that its size exceeds the configured per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes (default 1MB), Envoy generates a local reply whose headers override the original response headers, leaving dangling references and causing a crash. This results in denial of service. Updating to versions 1.36.2, 1.35.6, 1.34.10, or 1.33.12 fixes the issue. Increasing per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes (and for HTTP/2 the initial_stream_window_size) or increasing per_request_buffer_limit_bytes / request_body_buffer_limit can reduce the likelihood of triggering the condition but does not correct the underlying memory safety flaw.
