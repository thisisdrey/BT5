# Q1885: Exchange offer lifecycle: cashflow timing / bundle inconsistency / one live offer state

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active while the deadline is close enough that ordering and timestamp boundaries matter and make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert, breaking the rule that an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan and leading to Loans NFT being stuck or left under a stale exchange lock?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active
- Exploit idea: make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert
- Invariant to test: an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being stuck or left under a stale exchange lock
- Fast validation: Model cashflow accrual during an active offer and assert settlement cannot mix old storage with new economic state improperly.
