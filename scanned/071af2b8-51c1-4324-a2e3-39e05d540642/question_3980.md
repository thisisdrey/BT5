# Q3980: Smart account deployment and initialization: nonce race / unexpected privilege / ownership binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with deployment timing around the deployer-specific nonce and predicted address observation while the factory is deploying a brand-new Safe through the standard proxy path and make duplicate or crafted initializer arrays install more delegate or allowance surface than intended, breaking the rule that deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold and leading to Cross-user confusion about who controls a newly deployed operational account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: deployment timing around the deployer-specific nonce and predicted address observation
- Exploit idea: make duplicate or crafted initializer arrays install more delegate or allowance surface than intended
- Invariant to test: deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user confusion about who controls a newly deployed operational account
- Fast validation: Fuzz initializer arrays and duplicate entries, then assert the resulting Safe has exactly the declared owners, threshold, delegates, and routes.
