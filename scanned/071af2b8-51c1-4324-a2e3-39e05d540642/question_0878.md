# Q0878: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: vault-held loan / cross-user wedge / entitlement isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with payments into a loan currently owned by a vault that will later rely on NAV-sensitive approvals while an investor or vault cashflow collection could run soon after the borrower payment and create value that is trapped, mispriced, or unfairly attributed until a trusted role intervenes, breaking the rule that a borrower should not be able to distort another user's principal or interest entitlements just by timing ordinary payments and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution between current and future investors or shareholders?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: payments into a loan currently owned by a vault that will later rely on NAV-sensitive approvals
- Exploit idea: create value that is trapped, mispriced, or unfairly attributed until a trusted role intervenes
- Invariant to test: a borrower should not be able to distort another user's principal or interest entitlements just by timing ordinary payments
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution between current and future investors or shareholders
- Fast validation: Check that repeated ordinary payments cannot create a durable wedge between on-chain cash and user-withdrawable or priceable balances.
