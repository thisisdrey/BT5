# Q5404: interest-rate via borrow: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `borrow` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
