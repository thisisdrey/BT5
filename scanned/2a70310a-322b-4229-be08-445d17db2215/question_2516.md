# Q2516: calc-index-next via redeem: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `recipient` reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `redeem` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with `recipient` varied, and assert that the value `calc-index-next` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
