# Q0413: total-supply-preview via supply-collateral-add: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, drive `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) — which adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against — to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, breaking the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
