## Details
A vulnerability in the EthosVouch fee mechanism allows users to reduce fees when vouching a subject. By splitting their vouching process into multiple smaller transactions, users can partially reclaim vouchersPoolFee, resulting in significantly lower total fees compared to a single large transaction. This exploit undermines the intended fee structure and results in financial losses for other previous vouchers.  
The vouchersPoolFee is redistributed to existing vouchers. By vouching with a smaller value initially, a user becomes an existing voucher and subsequently benefits from vouchersPoolFee in subsequent EthosVouch::increaseVouch calls. The logic does not distinguish between fees for new vouches and subsequent increases, enabling fee circumvention.

Internal pre-conditions  
None

External pre-conditions  
1. There is at least one other existing voucher to receive part of the vouchersPoolFee.

Attack Path  
1. A user initially vouches with a smaller value (e.g., 10 ETH instead of the intended 100 ETH).  
2. The user becomes an existing voucher and receives part of the vouchersPoolFee.  
3. The user repeatedly calls increaseVouch in smaller increments (e.g., 10 ETH per transaction) to reach the intended total vouch value.  
4. In each increaseVouch call, the user reclaims part of the vouchersPoolFee, significantly reducing the total fees paid.  
5. Existing vouchers lose part of the intended fee revenue. In the provided example, the user saves approximately 2.54 ETH in fees for a 100 ETH vouch.

## Proof of Concept
Example: User A wants to vouch with 100 ETH for a subject S. User B has already vouched with 1 ETH for that subject. The fees are defined as follows:  
• entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 100 (1%)  
• entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = 200 (2%)  
• entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 300 (3%)

If User A simply calls the EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId function with a msg.value of 100 ETH, they will pay approximately 0.99 ETH to the protocol, 1.96 ETH to the subject S, and 2.91 ETH to User B (the only previous voucher). This means they will pay a total of around 5.86 ETH in fees, and their vouch balance will be 94.14 ETH.

However, if User A wants to pay fewer fees, they can call the EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId function with a msg.value of 10 ETH and then call the EthosVouch::increaseVouch function nine more times, each with 10 ETH. By doing this, User A becomes a previous voucher and receives part of the vouchersPoolFee. In the end, their vouch balance will be approximately 96.68 ETH, meaning they paid 2.54 ETH less in fees (5.86 ETH - 3.32 ETH) compared to the first case.

## Recommendation
Exclude the vouching user from receiving vouchersPoolFee during their own transactions
