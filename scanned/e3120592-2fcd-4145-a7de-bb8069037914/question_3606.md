# Q3606: log_unrooted_optimistic_slots accepts input it should reject (optimistic_confirmation_verifier.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `log_unrooted_optimistic_slots` in `core/src/optimistic_confirmation_verifier.rs` with two distinct inputs chosen so the digest input is ambiguous (missing domain separation), and have `log_unrooted_optimistic_slots` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`log_unrooted_optimistic_slots` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/optimistic_confirmation_verifier.rs` -> `log_unrooted_optimistic_slots()` (around line 92)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: two distinct inputs chosen so the digest input is ambiguous (missing domain separation)
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `log_unrooted_optimistic_slots` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `log_unrooted_optimistic_slots` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `log_unrooted_optimistic_slots` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
