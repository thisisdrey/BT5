# [M] ERC20 tokens that have a fee-on-transfer mechanism require special handling

## Details
Some tokens take a transfer fee (STA, PAXG) and there are some that currently do not but might do so in the future (USDT, USDC). Since Zerem might be integrated with a protocol that works with all types of ERC20 tokens, and Zerem should too, this can lead to problems.
Let’s look at the following scenario:
1. Alice tries to claim tokens that have a fee-on-transfer mechanism from a protocol that is integrated with Zerem
2. The integrated protocol calls Zerem::transferTo method but the amount argument passed does not take the fee into consideration
3. The require(transferredAmount >= amount, "not enough tokens"); check will always fail, since the transferredAmount will be less than amount due to the fee
If this happens this means that all of users balances of such tokens won’t be claimable and stuck forever.
If a token with a fee-on-transfer mechanism is used and not properly handled on both the integration protocol and Zerem’s side, it can result in 100% stuck balances of this token of users. Since this happens only with a special type of ERC20 it is Medium severity.

## Recommendation
Integration of such tokens will require special handling on the integrating protocol side (pre-calculating the fee, so the amount argument passed has the correct value) and possibly on Zerem’s side. Consider either better documentation for those or advise integrating protocols to not transfer such tokens through Zerem.
