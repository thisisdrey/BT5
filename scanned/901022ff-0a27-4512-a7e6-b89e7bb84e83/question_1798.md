# Q1798: Exchange offer lifecycle: address-book churn / lock residue / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance while every listed loan is locked to the exchange while the offer is live and make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance
- Exploit idea: make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
