# Q1464: iter-lookup-debt via collateral-remove: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) reach `iter-lookup-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218` -> `iter-lookup-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `iter-lookup-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
