# Q1046: slot_limit lets one client starve others (entry_bytes_budget.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `slot_limit` in `runtime/src/bank/entry_bytes_budget.rs` with a request that stays one unit under the limit but repeats within a single transaction, and occupy the shared capacity `slot_limit` arbitrates so honest fee-paying traffic is dropped, so that the invariant "No single source can hold more than its share of the shared capacity `slot_limit` manages." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/entry_bytes_budget.rs` -> `slot_limit()` (around line 22)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a request that stays one unit under the limit but repeats within a single transaction
- Exploit idea: Occupy the shared structure `slot_limit` arbitrates so legitimate fee-paying traffic is dropped or indefinitely deferred.
- Invariant to test: No single source can hold more than its share of the shared capacity `slot_limit` manages.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Run adversarial and honest load together; assert honest throughput stays above its fair share.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply force sigverify, dedup, scheduling, or buffering work that vastly exceeds the fees ever collected, degrading the leader below true cost.
