# Q44: get_asset_shares: rounding boundary creates extractable dust [a-deposit-immediately-after-a] [cycle]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `lending_account_deposit` with a deposit immediately after a permissionless price-cache refresh for the same bank to push `get_asset_shares` across a rounding edge where protocol totals and user shares no longer match, breaking `deposited assets must map to exactly one conservative internal share increase and never create withdrawable phantom value` and eventually causing `Critical: direct theft or unauthorized withdrawal of protocol/user funds`? Focus specifically on whether the attacker can repeat the same path in a short deterministic cycle to compound a one-step drift.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/bank.rs` / `get_asset_shares`
- Entrypoint: `lending_account_deposit`
- Attacker controls: a deposit immediately after a permissionless price-cache refresh for the same bank
- Exploit idea: Search for floor/ceil mismatches between user-facing token amounts and internal share accounting near zero, one-share, or threshold-sized transitions. Focus specifically on whether the attacker can repeat the same path in a short deterministic cycle to compound a one-step drift.
- Invariant to test: deposited assets must map to exactly one conservative internal share increase and never create withdrawable phantom value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: direct theft or unauthorized withdrawal of protocol/user funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz tiny and boundary amounts around the relevant threshold and assert that repeated cycles cannot increase withdrawable assets or decrease repayable debt. Run the target path in a short deposit/withdraw or borrow/repay style loop and assert no monotonic gain appears.
