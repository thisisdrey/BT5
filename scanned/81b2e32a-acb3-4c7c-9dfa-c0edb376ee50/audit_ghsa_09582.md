# [M] openssl-encrypt has no owner verification on key revocation — any client can revoke any key

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-hvc7-763r-4f3h
CWE: CWE-862
Ecosystem: PyPI
CVSS: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U (CVSS_V4)

Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- PyPI: `openssl-encrypt` — affected >=0 <1.4.0

## Details
### Summary

The `revoke_key` method in `openssl_encrypt_server/modules/keyserver/service.py` at **lines 195-270** accepts a `client_id` parameter but never verifies that the requesting client is the same as `key.owner_client_id`.

### Impact

Any authenticated client can revoke any other client's key, as long as they provide a valid revocation signature. While the signature requirement mitigates this somewhat (you need the private key to sign), the lack of ownership check is a defense-in-depth gap.

### Recommended Fix

- Add an ownership check: verify `client_id == key.owner_client_id` before allowing revocation
- Return 403 Forbidden if the requesting client does not own the key

### Fix

Fixed in commit `05e45f3` on branch `releases/1.4.x` — added documentation that ML-DSA signature verification IS the cryptographic ownership check; added info-level logging on successful verification.
