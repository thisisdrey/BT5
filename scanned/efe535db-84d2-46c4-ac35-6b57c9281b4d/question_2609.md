# Q2609: is-liquidation-paused via liquidate: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, drive `is-liquidation-paused` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691) — which returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live — to convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction, breaking the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction, and cause permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691` -> `is-liquidation-paused`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `is-liquidation-paused` returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live. Reach it through `liquidate` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `borrower`, any third-party principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
