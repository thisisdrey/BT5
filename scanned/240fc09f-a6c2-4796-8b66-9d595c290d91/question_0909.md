# Q0909: lib - wNEAR debited but NEAR never delivered (5)

## Question
Given the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_on_transfer` / `nft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` from a token contract the attacker wrote, make the `near_withdraw` unwrap or the follow-on call reached from `near_withdraw` in `crates/near/wnear/src/lib.rs` fail after the signer's wNEAR was already subtracted, with no refund path, breaking the invariant `wNEAR debited from an account == NEAR that reached the named receiver, or was returned to that account` and leading to permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/near/wnear/src/lib.rs](crates/near/wnear/src/lib.rs) - `near_withdraw` (cross-check `NEAR_WITHDRAW_GAS` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_on_transfer` / `nft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` from a token contract the attacker wrote
- Attacker controls: `sender_id`, `amount`, the `msg` (receiver, notify, or nested intents), and the token's own behaviour
- Exploit idea: `native_withdraw`, `storage_deposit`, deposit-bearing `auth_call` and `FtWithdraw::storage_deposit` all debit first and document that wNEAR is not refunded on failure. Set-up: the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value.
- Invariant to test: wNEAR debited from an account == NEAR that reached the named receiver, or was returned to that account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)
- Fast validation: Point the receiver at a non-existent or reverting account; assert whether the wNEAR is recoverable.
