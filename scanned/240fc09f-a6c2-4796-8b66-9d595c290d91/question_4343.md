# Q4343: multi - truncation / length-prefix ambiguity in the signed envelope (3)

## Question
Given the victim account has no entry in `self.accounts`, so `has_public_key` falls back to implicit-key derivation, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` `msg` carrying `DepositAction::Execute { execute_intents }` from a token the attacker deployed, exploit an unlength-prefixed or ambiguously delimited field in `MultiPayload` of `contracts/defuse/core/src/payload/multi.rs` so two semantically different messages serialise to the same signed pre-image, breaking the invariant `the pre-image `MultiPayload` signs == a unique, unambiguous encoding of exactly one `DefusePayload`` and leading to direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/core/src/payload/multi.rs](contracts/defuse/core/src/payload/multi.rs) - `MultiPayload` (cross-check `extract_defuse_payload` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` `msg` carrying `DepositAction::Execute { execute_intents }` from a token the attacker deployed
- Attacker controls: the deposit `msg` string and every `MultiPayload` nested inside it
- Exploit idea: Move bytes across a delimiter between adjacent variable-length fields (account id, memo, msg, token id) so the concatenation is identical but the parse differs. Set-up: the victim account has no entry in `self.accounts`, so `has_public_key` falls back to implicit-key derivation.
- Invariant to test: the pre-image `MultiPayload` signs == a unique, unambiguous encoding of exactly one `DefusePayload`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation
- Fast validation: Find two distinct `DefusePayload` values whose `MultiPayload` pre-images are byte-equal; assert one signature authorises both.
