# Q3858: convert-to-assets-preview via accrue: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, can an unprivileged attacker make `convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`, so the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `accrue` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `convert-to-assets-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
