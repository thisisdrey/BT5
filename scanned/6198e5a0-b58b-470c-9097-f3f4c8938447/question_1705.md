# Q1705: Exchange offer lifecycle: accept timing / misbound whitelist / one live offer state

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer-controlled acceptance timing near expiry or around other state changes while the offer contains multiple loans whose economic state can diverge while storage stays static and make the mutual-registration checks bind the wrong effective buyer or seller at settlement time, breaking the rule that an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer-controlled acceptance timing near expiry or around other state changes
- Exploit idea: make the mutual-registration checks bind the wrong effective buyer or seller at settlement time
- Invariant to test: an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
