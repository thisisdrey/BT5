# Q0232: find-superset via borrow: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `borrow` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
