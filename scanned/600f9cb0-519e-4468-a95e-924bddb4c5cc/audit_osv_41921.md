# [H] drm/virtio: use uninterruptible resv lock for plane updates

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-64098
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2026-07-19
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-64098
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=5.7.0 <6.1.175, >=6.2.0 <6.6.142, >=6.7.0 <6.12.92, >=6.13.0 <6.18.34, >=6.19.0 <7.0.11

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/virtio: use uninterruptible resv lock for plane updates

virtio_gpu_cursor_plane_update() and virtio_gpu_resource_flush() lock
the framebuffer BO's dma_resv via virtio_gpu_array_lock_resv() and
ignore its return value. The function can fail with -EINTR from
dma_resv_lock_interruptible() (signal during lock wait) or with
-ENOMEM from dma_resv_reserve_fences() (fence slot allocation),
leaving the resv lock not held. The queue path then walks the object
array and calls dma_resv_add_fence(), which requires the lock held;
with lockdep enabled this trips dma_resv_assert_held():

  WARNING: drivers/dma-buf/dma-resv.c:296 at dma_resv_add_fence+0x71e/0x840
  Call Trace:
   virtio_gpu_array_add_fence

Beyond the WARN, mutating the dma_resv fence list without the lock
races with concurrent readers/writers and can corrupt the list.

Both call sites run inside the .atomic_update plane callback, which
DRM atomic helpers do not allow to fail (by the time it runs, the
commit has been signed off to userspace and there is no clean
rollback path). Moving the lock acquisition to .prepare_fb was
rejected because the broader lock scope deadlocks against other BO
locking paths in the same atomic commit.

Introduce virtio_gpu_lock_one_resv_uninterruptible() that uses
dma_resv_lock() instead of dma_resv_lock_interruptible(). This
eliminates the -EINTR failure mode -- the realistic syzbot trigger
-- without extending the lock hold across the commit. The helper
locks a single BO and rejects nents > 1 with -EINVAL; both fix
sites lock exactly one BO.

Use it from virtio_gpu_cursor_plane_update() and
virtio_gpu_resource_flush(); check the return value to handle the
remaining -ENOMEM case from dma_resv_reserve_fences() by freeing
the objs and skipping the plane update for that frame. The
framebuffer BOs touched here are not shared with other contexts
and lock contention is expected to be brief, so the loss of
signal-interruptibility is acceptable.

Other callers of virtio_gpu_array_lock_resv() (the ioctl paths)
continue to use the interruptible variant.

The bug was reported by syzbot, triggered via fault injection
(fail_nth) on the DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CURSOR path, which forces the
-ENOMEM branch in dma_resv_reserve_fences().
