# [H] media: ivsc: Fix crash at shutdown due to missing mei_cldev_disable() calls

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2025-39711
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2025-09-05
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2025-39711
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=6.6.0 <6.6.103, >=6.7.0 <6.12.44, >=6.13.0 <6.16.4

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: ivsc: Fix crash at shutdown due to missing mei_cldev_disable() calls

Both the ACE and CSI driver are missing a mei_cldev_disable() call in
their remove() function.

This causes the mei_cl client to stay part of the mei_device->file_list
list even though its memory is freed by mei_cl_bus_dev_release() calling
kfree(cldev->cl).

This leads to a use-after-free when mei_vsc_remove() runs mei_stop()
which first removes all mei bus devices calling mei_ace_remove() and
mei_csi_remove() followed by mei_cl_bus_dev_release() and then calls
mei_cl_all_disconnect() which walks over mei_device->file_list dereferecing
the just freed cldev->cl.

And mei_vsc_remove() it self is run at shutdown because of the
platform_device_unregister(tp->pdev) in vsc_tp_shutdown()

When building a kernel with KASAN this leads to the following KASAN report:

Add the missing mei_cldev_disable() calls so that the mei_cl gets removed
from mei_device->file_list before it is freed to fix this.
