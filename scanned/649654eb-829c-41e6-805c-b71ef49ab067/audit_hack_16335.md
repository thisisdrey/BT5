## Details
# Issue from the previous audit not resolved
## Summary
The `MarketFactory` contract lacks a mechanism for withdrawing protocol fees collected from individual markets. When markets claim protocol fees, these fees are sent to the `MarketFactory` contract but cannot be accessed or utilized because there is no function in the contract to transfer these funds out. This results in the locking of protocol fees within the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A withdrawal mechanism should be implemented in the `MarketFactory` contract. This mechanism would allow the contract owner or authorized parties to withdraw protocol fees from the contract and transfer them to a designated address, such as a multisig wallet or treasury. The withdrawal function should include proper access controls and security measures to ensure the safe management of collected fees.
