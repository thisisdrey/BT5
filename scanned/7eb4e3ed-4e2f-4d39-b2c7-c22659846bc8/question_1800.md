# Q1800: Exchange offer lifecycle: address-book churn / lock residue / exact counterparties

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance while every listed loan is locked to the exchange while the offer is live and make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone, breaking the rule that mutual investor-registration checks should bind the exact buyer and seller that receive settlement value and leading to Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance
- Exploit idea: make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone
- Invariant to test: mutual investor-registration checks should bind the exact buyer and seller that receive settlement value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement
- Fast validation: Simulate cancel/relist cycles and ensure no listed loan remains locked or economically bound to a dead offer.
