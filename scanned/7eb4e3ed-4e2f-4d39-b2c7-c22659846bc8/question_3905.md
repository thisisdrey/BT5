# Q3905: Smart account deployment and initialization: duplicate entries / init replay / one-shot configure

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays while the factory is deploying a brand-new Safe through the standard proxy path and make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe, breaking the rule that `configureSmartAccount` should run at most once and only in the intended delegatecall context of a fresh Safe and leading to Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays
- Exploit idea: make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe
- Invariant to test: `configureSmartAccount` should run at most once and only in the intended delegatecall context of a fresh Safe
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account
- Fast validation: Check that no foreign Safe or Safe-like contract can abuse the factory's delegatecall-based initializer to install new module state.
