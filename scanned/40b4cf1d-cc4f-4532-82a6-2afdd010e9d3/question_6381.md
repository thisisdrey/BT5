# Q6381: Domain Separation Slip in common_prefix_bits_len

## Question
Can `crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs::common_prefix_bits_len` be reached with the same cryptographic material reused across different domains, messages, chains, or contexts, allowing replay or authorization in the wrong place?

## Target
- File/function: crates/aptos-crypto/src/hash.rs::common_prefix_bits_len
- Entrypoint: Submit a transaction, proof, signature set, or package whose cryptographic material reaches `common_prefix_bits_len` in production validation or execution.
- Attacker controls: signature bytes, public keys, aggregated key sets, proof elements, message bytes, domain-separation inputs, and malformed encodings
- Exploit idea: Exploit missing or inconsistent domain separation in signatures, proofs, or transcript construction.
- Invariant to test: Every cryptographic check must bind to one exact message domain, chain context, and authorization purpose.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Unauthorized transaction execution, replay, signer confusion, signature or proof misbinding, or sequence and authorization bypass that lets an unprivileged attacker cause state transitions on behalf of another user or module context.
- Fast validation: Build cross-domain test vectors that reuse the same material under shifted context and assert strict rejection outside the intended domain.
