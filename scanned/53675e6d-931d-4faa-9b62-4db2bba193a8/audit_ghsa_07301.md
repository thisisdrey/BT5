# [M] LiteLLM: Arbitrary file write via path traversal in Skills archive extraction

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-5jmr-gcrj-2c9q
CVE: CVE-2026-59820
CWE: CWE-22
Ecosystem: PyPI
CVSS: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N (CVSS_V4)
Published: 2026-07-22
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5jmr-gcrj-2c9q
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- PyPI: `litellm` — affected >=0 <1.83.7

## Details
### Impact

LiteLLM Skills archive extraction did not sufficiently validate file paths from uploaded skill ZIP archives. An authenticated user with access to LiteLLM LLM API routes, or a key whose `allowed_routes` includes `/v1/skills`, `anthropic_routes`, or `llm_api_routes`, could upload a crafted skill archive containing path traversal entries.

When the skill was processed for execution, those entries could be written outside the intended extraction/staging directory. This could allow arbitrary file write and may lead to code execution depending on deployment configuration and writable paths.

### Patches

The issue is fixed in `1.83.7-stable`.

LiteLLM recommens upgrading to `1.83.7-stable` or later.

### Workarounds

If upgrading is not immediately possible:

1. Block `POST /v1/skills` at your reverse proxy or API gateway.
2. Restrict Skills API access to trusted users only.
