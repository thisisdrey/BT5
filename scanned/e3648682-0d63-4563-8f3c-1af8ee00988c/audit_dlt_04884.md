# Nonce of Order/SellOrder does not fit its orginal meaning

## Summary
Nonce of Order/SellOrder does not fit its orginal meaning. I.e., for the same user, an order B is maked and matched later than order A, but the nonce of order B can be smaller than order A‘s. 

## Vulnerability Detail
For example of Order, `struct Order`  is defined in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L33-L44

All the parameters of Order is user-defined, including the nonce parameter that only requires greater or equal to minimumValidNonce without any self-increasing mechanism.

It would possibly make an out of time-ordered nonce sequence for an user's orders, causing some misleading sort for showing and tracking.

## Impact
An out of time-ordered nonce sequence can cause some misleading sort for showing and tracking users' orders.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To add a self-increasing mechanism for `Order.nonce` and `SellOrder.nonce`. And it is better to add a chain ID to `struct Order` and  `SellOrder` to avoid the same hash problem if bullvbear plans to deploy on multi-chains in the future.
