# Q3571: accrue-and-cache via call-ststx-ratio: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
`accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Can an unprivileged caller of `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), by choosing whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, use that to make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree, violating the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `call-ststx-ratio` with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, then read `accrue-and-cache` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
