# Q5979: state part boundaries over attacker-grown state — split.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys, state grown so a single account's data spans a state-part boundary at the maximum part size, when the same value is written and deleted by many accounts in one chunk, and additionally when a delete forces sibling nodes to be squashed, reach `extension_to_nibbles` in `core/store/src/trie/split.rs` and produce a part set that does not reassemble to the same root, breaking the invariant that state parts partition the trie exactly and reassemble to the identical root, leading to Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/trie/split.rs` :: `extension_to_nibbles`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys
- Attacker controls: state grown so a single account's data spans a state-part boundary at the maximum part size; when the same value is written and deleted by many accounts in one chunk; when a delete forces sibling nodes to be squashed
- Exploit idea: produce a part set that does not reassemble to the same root
- Invariant to test: state parts partition the trie exactly and reassemble to the identical root
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)
- Fast validation: test splitting and reassembling attacker-shaped state
