## Details
# User can set setMinimumValidNonce to uint256.max

## Summary
User can set setMinimumValidNonce to uint256.max and lose ability to cancel orders using nonce.
## Vulnerability Detail
`setMinimumValidNonce` allows user to increase his nonce to cancel orders with previous nonces.
To increase nonce he should provide number bigger than current nonce. 
It's possible that user will mistakenly increase his nonce to uin256.max and will lose ability to increase nonce anymore.
Then he will not be able to cancel batch of orders quickly if prices will change.
## Impact
User lose ability to cancel orders with nonce.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Didn't find good solution. Though about restrict call of setMinimumValidNonce to increase nonce for a some maximum amount(for example 1000). Then if he wants to cancel orders with nonce < 3000, he need to call method 3 times.
