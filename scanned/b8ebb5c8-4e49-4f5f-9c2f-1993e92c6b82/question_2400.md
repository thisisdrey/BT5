# Q2400: merge-price via collateral-remove-redeem: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-underlying` reach `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-underlying` across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `merge-price` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
