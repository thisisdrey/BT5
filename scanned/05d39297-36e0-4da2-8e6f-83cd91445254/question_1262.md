# Q1262: vault-accrue via collateral-add: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order varied, and assert that the value `vault-accrue` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
