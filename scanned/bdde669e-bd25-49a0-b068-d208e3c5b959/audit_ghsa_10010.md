# [H] Antrea has Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-qcmw-8mm4-4p28
CVE: CVE-2026-34992
CWE: CWE-311
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-04-03

Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `antrea.io/antrea` — affected >=1.11.0
- Go: `antrea.io/antrea` — affected >=2.5.0
- Go: `antrea.io/antrea` — affected >=0 <1.11.0-alpha.0.0.20260225185322-738bad662b20

## Details
### Impact
This is a missing encryption vulnerability (CWE-311) affecting inter-Node Pod traffic. In Antrea clusters configured for dual-stack networking with IPsec encryption enabled (`trafficEncryptionMode: ipsec`), Antrea fails to apply encryption for IPv6 Pod traffic.

While the IPv4 traffic is correctly encrypted via ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), traffic using IPv6 is transmitted in plaintext. This occurs because the packets are encapsulated (using Geneve or VXLAN) but bypass the IPsec encryption layer.

Impacted Users: users with dual-stack clusters and IPsec encryption enabled.

Single-stack IPv4 or IPv6 clusters are not affected.

### Patches
Yes, the issue has been patched: https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7759
Users should upgrade to one of the following versions:
* Antrea v2.6.0 or later
* Antrea v2.5.2
* Antrea v2.4.5

Antrea recommends running the `antctl check installation --run ipsec` tool after upgrading to verify that both address families are correctly producing ESP traffic.

### Workarounds
There is no configuration workaround to enable IPsec IPv6 in affected versions. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, user may consider using WireGuard instead for inter-Node Pod traffic encryption. The WireGuard support in Antrea does *not* suffer from the same issue.
