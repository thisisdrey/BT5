# Q1505: resolve-ststx via supply-collateral-add: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `amount`, drive `resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) — which calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down` — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
