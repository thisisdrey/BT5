# Q3892: price-multi-resolve via liquidate: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `borrower`, any third-party principal reach `price-multi-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end, the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397` -> `price-multi-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Reach it through `liquidate` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
