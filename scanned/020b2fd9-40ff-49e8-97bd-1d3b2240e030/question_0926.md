# Q926: initialize: freeze semantics can be bypassed through an alternate user flow [an-init-call-where-the] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker bypass the intended freeze semantics by invoking `initialize_account` with an init call where the target account key has historical state from another workflow so `initialize` still changes a blocked account, violating `new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context` and causing `High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `initialize`
- Entrypoint: `initialize_account`
- Attacker controls: an init call where the target account key has historical state from another workflow
- Exploit idea: Audit alternate user flows that eventually touch the same balances but may not call the common frozen-account guard. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze
- Fast validation: Freeze the account, exercise alternate paths, and assert every value-moving route rejects before any state mutation occurs. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
