# Q1632: vault-system-borrow via liquidate: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `borrower`, any third-party principal reach `vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `borrower`, any third-party principal across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `vault-system-borrow` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
