# Q0512: Loans funding and disbursement state: lock cycle / epoch confusion / same-loan accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a normal list-lock-unlock cycle around the same loan before funding or disbursement while a vault, buyer, or downstream counterparty could rely on the resulting balances after funding or disbursement and make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions, breaking the rule that funding or disbursing one loan should never create withdrawable or priceable balances attributable to another loan or investor and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a normal list-lock-unlock cycle around the same loan before funding or disbursement
- Exploit idea: make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions
- Invariant to test: funding or disbursing one loan should never create withdrawable or priceable balances attributable to another loan or investor
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing
- Fast validation: Assert that any failed disbursement or replay attempt reverts without leaving priceable or withdrawable balances behind.
