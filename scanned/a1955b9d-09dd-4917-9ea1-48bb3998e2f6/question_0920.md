# Q0920: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: multi-epoch pay / timing gap / no exploitable pricing gap

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with multiple borrower payments straddling a due-date or withdrawal boundary while no waterfall has yet moved the fresh payment out of `ACC_BORROWER_PAYMENT_CLEARING` and create a borrower-controlled timing gap where real cash exists on-chain but pricing or withdrawal paths still see the wrong balances, breaking the rule that a borrower-controlled payment timing sequence should not let another unprivileged user exploit a vault approval or withdrawal against stale economic state and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution between current and future investors or shareholders?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: multiple borrower payments straddling a due-date or withdrawal boundary
- Exploit idea: create a borrower-controlled timing gap where real cash exists on-chain but pricing or withdrawal paths still see the wrong balances
- Invariant to test: a borrower-controlled payment timing sequence should not let another unprivileged user exploit a vault approval or withdrawal against stale economic state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution between current and future investors or shareholders
- Fast validation: Model a vault-held loan, have the borrower pay just before NAV-sensitive approvals, and assert no stale-price claim becomes possible.
