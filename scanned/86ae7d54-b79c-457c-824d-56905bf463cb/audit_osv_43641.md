# [C] KVM: x86: Cancel delayed I/O APIC EOI handling before destroying vCPUs

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: CVE-2026-74517
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 9.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2026-08-15
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-74517
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=0 <6.12.105, >=6.13.0 <6.18.46, >=6.14.0 <7.1.8

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Cancel delayed I/O APIC EOI handling before destroying vCPUs

Cancel (and flush) the I/O APIC's delayed EOI handling work during the
"pre VM destroy" phase, before vCPUs are destroyed, as processing the EOI
broadcast will inject another IRQ if the line is asserted, i.e. will try
to deliver an IRQ to the target vCPU(s).  Canceling the work after vCPUs
are destroyed leads to UAF if the delayed work is processed after vCPUs are
destroyed.

Note, the VM is unreachable once kvm_destroy_vm() starts, and scheduling
new work via kvm_ioapic_send_eoi() can only be done via KVM_RUN, i.e.
requires a live vCPU.

Alternatively, KVM could simply destroy the I/O APIC during the "pre" phase
of VM destruction, but that gets more than a bit sketchy as KVM expects the
I/O APIC to exist if ioapic_in_kernel() is true, and nested virtualization
in particular has a bad habit of touching VM-scope state during vCPU
destruction.  E.g. attempting to free the PIC during the pre phase would
lead to a NULL pointer dereference in kvm_cpu_has_extint(), and it's not
hard to imagine the I/O APIC having a similar flaw.
