# Q1527: find-and-resolve-asset-value via liquidate: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
`find-and-resolve-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668) reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `collateral-receiver`, use that to turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668` -> `find-and-resolve-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Reach it through `liquidate` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `find-and-resolve-asset-value` touches, run `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
