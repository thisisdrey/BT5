# Q0043: total-debt via supply-collateral-add: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, then read `total-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
