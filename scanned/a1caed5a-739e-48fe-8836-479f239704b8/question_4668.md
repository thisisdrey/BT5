# Q4668: insert via liquidate-redeem: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the borrower targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `insert` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
