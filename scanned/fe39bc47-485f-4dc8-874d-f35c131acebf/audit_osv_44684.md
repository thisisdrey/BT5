# [M] HTML::FormHandler versions before 0.410002 for Perl render some error messages into HTML without escaping

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-85485
CVSS: 6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
Published: 2026-09-08

Type: osv

## Details
HTML::FormHandler versions before 0.410002 for Perl render some error messages into HTML without escaping.

The Table form layout and the Bootstrap 2 and 3 wrappers splice each error string straight into the surrounding markup. Version 0.410000, the fix for CVE-2026-19872, escaped the equivalent values in the other layouts and wrappers, and 0.410002 extended that to these three.

Error messages that contain attacker-influenced content such as rejected field values could embed JavaScript in rendered pages.
