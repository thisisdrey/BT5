## Details
# Replay attack for order is possible

## Summary
Replay attack for order is possible when attacker is a bull by transfering attacker position to address 0 after settlement and then creating same order again.
## Vulnerability Detail
Before new order is matched there is a [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L760) that order doesn't exists yet.
`require(bulls[uint(orderHash)] == address(0), "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED");`
This check supposes that if order is already created he can't have bull with address 0.

Also there is function `transferPosition` which allows anyone to [send his position](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L521-L538) to any address.

This creates next attack vector.

1.Victim created order as bear.
2.Attacker matches this order.
3.Victim settles order before expire.
4.Attacker transfers his position to address(0)
5.Attacker matches same order again. Because of max allowance that is provided by victim it will be possible to create new order.

As result, because contract was already settled before it will be not possible for both bear and bull to get back their premium and collateral and it will be also not possible for settle this order again. Provided funds will be lost.
## Impact
Attacker makes victim to lose funds, and lose own funds as well.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check that order exist like this `require(matchedOrders[uint(orderHash)].maker == address(0), "ORDER_MATCHED");`
