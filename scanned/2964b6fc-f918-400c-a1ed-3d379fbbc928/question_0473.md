# Q0473: Loans funding and disbursement state: lock cycle / phase skip / single funding

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a normal list-lock-unlock cycle around the same loan before funding or disbursement while status-like fields or off-chain expectations changed nearby but the economic balances still define the real state and make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable, breaking the rule that `fund` should only succeed once per loan and only for the current NFT owner of that same loan and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a normal list-lock-unlock cycle around the same loan before funding or disbursement
- Exploit idea: make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable
- Invariant to test: `fund` should only succeed once per loan and only for the current NFT owner of that same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement
- Fast validation: Model a create-transfer-fund-disburse sequence and assert stale ownership or stale lock state never authorizes a later epoch.
