# Q3859: Smart account deployment and initialization: init arrays / init replay / initializer fidelity

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer while a second configuration attempt is made against a Safe that already ran initialization once and make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe, breaking the rule that duplicate or crafted array inputs should not silently widen module delegates or spending surface beyond the explicit initializer semantics and leading to Cross-user confusion about who controls a newly deployed operational account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer
- Exploit idea: make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe
- Invariant to test: duplicate or crafted array inputs should not silently widen module delegates or spending surface beyond the explicit initializer semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user confusion about who controls a newly deployed operational account
- Fast validation: Check that no foreign Safe or Safe-like contract can abuse the factory's delegatecall-based initializer to install new module state.
