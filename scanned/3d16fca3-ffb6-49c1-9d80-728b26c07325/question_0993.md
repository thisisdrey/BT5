# Q0993: receive-underlying via accrue: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, drive `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) — which pulls the underlying from a named account — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `accrue` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `receive-underlying` touches, run `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
