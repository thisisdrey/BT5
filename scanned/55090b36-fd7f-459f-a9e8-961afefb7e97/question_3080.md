# Q3080: eth-implicit account transfer path — ext.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `Transfer` action to a 64-hex implicit or 0x-prefixed eth-implicit account id, a 0x-prefixed eth-implicit id with mixed-case hex and an address that also parses as a named account, when combined with a DeployContract earlier in the same action list, and additionally when combined with a DeleteAccount later in the same action list, reach `append_action_add_gas_key_with_function_call` in `runtime/runtime/src/ext.rs` and reach a path where the eth-implicit account is initialised with the wallet contract but a mismatched address, breaking the invariant that the eth-implicit account id, its stored address, and the wallet-contract owner always agree, leading to High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/runtime/src/ext.rs` :: `append_action_add_gas_key_with_function_call`
- Entrypoint: a `Transfer` action to a 64-hex implicit or 0x-prefixed eth-implicit account id
- Attacker controls: a 0x-prefixed eth-implicit id with mixed-case hex and an address that also parses as a named account; when combined with a DeployContract earlier in the same action list; when combined with a DeleteAccount later in the same action list
- Exploit idea: reach a path where the eth-implicit account is initialised with the wallet contract but a mismatched address
- Invariant to test: the eth-implicit account id, its stored address, and the wallet-contract owner always agree
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass
- Fast validation: unit test comparing derived address against the deployed wallet contract's stored owner
