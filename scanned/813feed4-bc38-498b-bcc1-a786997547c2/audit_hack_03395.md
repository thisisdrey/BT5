## Details
# Protocol can lose the fee and withdrawal function can become useless.

## Summary

Fee on transfer tokens(for asset tokens) cause loss for the protocol and make the `withdrawFees` function useless.

## Vulnerability Detail

Although there is a whitelisting mechanism for asset tokens, it is possible for some tokens to be upgraded into fee-on-transfer types in the future. ([here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#balance-modifications-outside-of-transfers-rebasing--airdrops))
So a token that was whitelisted before can change into a fee-on-transfer one in the future.
If the admin does not blacklist it before any matching order, the protocol will receive fewer amounts while it sends out the original amount to the maker/taker on settlement or reclaims.
So this means every transaction will incur a loss of funds for the protocol and furthermore it will make `withdrawableFees` inconsistent and it prevents withdrawal of the fees.

## Impact

Protocol can lose the funds from fee and the withdrawal function can become useless.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Confirm the received amount in the function `matchOrder`.
2. Change the `withdrawFees` function as below just in case.

```solidity
function withdrawFees(address asset, address recipient) external onlyOwner {
    uint amount = withdrawableFees[asset];

    withdrawableFees[asset] = 0;

    IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(recipient, IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this))); //@audit use balanceOf instead of specific amount just in case

    emit WithdrawnFees(asset, amount);
}
```
