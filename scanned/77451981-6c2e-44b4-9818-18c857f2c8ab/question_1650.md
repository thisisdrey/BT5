# Q1650: data_size is not deterministic across nodes (rollback_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `data_size` in `svm/src/rollback_accounts.rs` with a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit, and make the compute units declared by the compute-budget instruction disagree with the compute units actually consumed, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `data_size` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/rollback_accounts.rs` -> `data_size()` (around line 140)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit
- Exploit idea: Find input to `data_size` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `data_size` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `data_size` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
