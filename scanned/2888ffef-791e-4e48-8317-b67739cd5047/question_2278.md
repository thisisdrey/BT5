# Q2278: Vault async redeem flow: split owner-controller / dust strand / global reserve sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses while the controller already has a prior claimable redeem or pending deposit position and strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be withdrawn or cancelled, breaking the rule that totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be withdrawn or cancelled
- Invariant to test: totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated redeem()/withdraw() calls against partially approved redemptions and assert reserve counters stay exact.
