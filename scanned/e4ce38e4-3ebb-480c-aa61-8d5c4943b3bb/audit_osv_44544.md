# [M] Gvfs: afp: heap-based buffer overflow in dsi read path

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-84269
CVSS: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2026-09-01
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-84269
Type: osv

## Details
A flaw was found in the AFP backend in gvfs. When mounting a share, a malicious AFP server can cause the DSI read path to process a length that exceeds the size requested by the client. The function does not verify the server-provided length against the pre-sized reply buffer, causing the operation to access past the intended boundaries. This issue allows a malicious server to overflow a heap buffer and crash the gvfsd-afp process, resulting in a denial of service.
