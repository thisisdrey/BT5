# Q2708: Vault NAV freshness and cross-contract state: loan transfer / stale holdings / no stale claims

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower, investor, buyer, seller, or shareholder interacting through ordinary protocol entrypoints enter through `Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals` with a normal ERC721 transfer of an attacker-owned loan NFT into or out of the vault address while deposit or redemption approvals are about to rely on `_requireFreshNav` and make a user-controlled holdings change slip past the freshness gates and leave `lastNav` usable when it should not be, breaking the rule that an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone and leading to Cross-user exploit window created by ordinary borrower, buyer, or seller timing?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / _requireFreshNav, updateNav, collectCashflows, fundLoans, createSaleOffer, acceptSaleOffer
- Entrypoint: Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals
- Attacker controls: a normal ERC721 transfer of an attacker-owned loan NFT into or out of the vault address
- Exploit idea: make a user-controlled holdings change slip past the freshness gates and leave `lastNav` usable when it should not be
- Invariant to test: an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user exploit window created by ordinary borrower, buyer, or seller timing
- Fast validation: Forge test a finalized NAV, then trigger a user-controlled payment, transfer, or offer acceptance and assert approvals revert until NAV is refreshed.
