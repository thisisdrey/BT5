# Q3575: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: erc20 route / expiry bypass / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with token, from, to, and amount across one allowed route and one nearby disallowed route while another Safe has a similar delegate or recipient topology but no matching route and spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: token, from, to, and amount across one allowed route and one nearby disallowed route
- Exploit idea: spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts
- Fast validation: Forge test one delegate across several Safes and routes and assert each transfer consumes only the exact approved route.
