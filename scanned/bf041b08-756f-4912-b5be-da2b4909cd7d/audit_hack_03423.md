## Details
# withdrawToken may not work

## Summary
withdrawToken may fail because recipient cannot be changed
## Vulnerability Detail
In the settleContract function, when sending NFT to bull fails, the address of bull will be stored in withdrawableCollectionTokenId, after which anyone can call the withdrawToken function to transfer the NFT to bull.
But if bull is a smart contract and does not implement the onERC721Received function, then sending NFT to bull in the withdrawToken function will also fail.
## Impact
bull cannot withdraw NFT through the withdrawToken function

## Recommendation
Consider only allowing the address in the withdrawableCollectionTokenId to call the withdrawToken function and specify the receiver
