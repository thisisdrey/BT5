# [H] Server-Side Request Forgery and Open Redirect in AllTube Download

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-75p7-527p-w8wp
CVE: CVE-2022-24739
CWE: CWE-601, CWE-918
Ecosystem: Packagist
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2022-03-09
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-75p7-527p-w8wp
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Packagist: `rudloff/alltube` — affected >=0 <3.0.3

## Details
### Impact

On releases prior to 3.0.3, an attacker could craft a special HTML page to trigger either an open redirect attack or a Server-Side Request Forgery attack (depending on how AllTube is configured).

The impact is mitigated by the fact the SSRF attack is only possible when the `stream` option is enabled in the configuration. (This option is disabled by default.)

### Patches

3.0.3 contains a fix for this vulnerability.
(The 1.x and 2.x releases are not maintained anymore.)

The fix requires applying [a patch](https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/blob/3d092891044f2685ed66c73c870a021bee319c37/patches/youtube-dl-disable-generic.diff) to youtube-dl to disable its generic extractor. If you are using the version of youtube-dl bundled with 3.0.3, it is already patched.
However, if you are using your own unpatched version of youtube-dl **you might still be vulnerable**.
