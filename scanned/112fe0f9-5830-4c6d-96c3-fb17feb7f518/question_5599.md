# Q5599: multi - hash/verify region mismatch (7)

## Question
Given the victim has registered exactly one public key, of a different curve than the one submitted, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` `msg` carrying `DepositAction::Execute { execute_intents }` from a token the attacker deployed, make `Payload::hash()` and `SignedPayload::verify()` in `contracts/defuse/core/src/payload/multi.rs` cover different byte ranges of the same `extract_defuse_payload`, so the `intent_hash` bound into emitted events and replay bookkeeping is not the digest the signature actually committed to, breaking the invariant ``hash()` of an accepted payload == the digest the signature verified over, for every accepted payload` and leading to direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/core/src/payload/multi.rs](contracts/defuse/core/src/payload/multi.rs) - `extract_defuse_payload` (cross-check `MultiPayload` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_on_transfer` / `mt_on_transfer` `msg` carrying `DepositAction::Execute { execute_intents }` from a token the attacker deployed
- Attacker controls: the deposit `msg` string and every `MultiPayload` nested inside it
- Exploit idea: Exploit that `hash()` digests one field (e.g. the raw `payload` string) while `verify()` runs over a reconstructed envelope, so two distinct payloads share a hash or one payload yields two hashes. Set-up: the victim has registered exactly one public key, of a different curve than the one submitted.
- Invariant to test: `hash()` of an accepted payload == the digest the signature verified over, for every accepted payload
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once
- Fast validation: Construct two `MultiPayload` values with equal `hash()` but different decoded intents; assert both pass `verify()` and that `execute_intents` accepts both.
