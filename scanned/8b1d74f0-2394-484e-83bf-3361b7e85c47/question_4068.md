# Q4068: merge-price via collateral-add: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position's existing collateral and debt composition reach `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position's existing collateral and debt composition across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `merge-price` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
