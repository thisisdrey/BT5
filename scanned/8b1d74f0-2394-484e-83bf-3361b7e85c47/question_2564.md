# Q2564: get-available-assets via supply-collateral-add: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `get-available-assets` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
