# Q3783: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: finite allowance / expiry bypass / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls while the route exists with a current positive allowance or a current NFT blanket approval and spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Protocol-facing unauthorized transfers that later harm another user or vault?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls
- Exploit idea: spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol-facing unauthorized transfers that later harm another user or vault
- Fast validation: Fuzz allowance expiry at the block boundary and ensure no post-expiry transfer succeeds for ERC20 or ERC721 routes.
