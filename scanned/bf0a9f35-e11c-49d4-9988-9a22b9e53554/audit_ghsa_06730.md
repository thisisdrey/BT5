# [H] Skipper: Incomplete fix for CVE-2026-50197: an oversized body can bypass OPA deny-on-presence Rego policies

## Summary

Advisory: GHSA-8qqm-fp2q-v734
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N (CVSS_V3)

## Details
### Summary

A wrong policy can be an open door. 
You have to check `input.attributes.request.http.truncated_body` in your policy.

### Description

Incomplete fix for CVE-2026-50197: an oversized declared-`Content-Length` body still hands OPA an empty `parsed_body`, so deny-on-presence Rego policies fail OPEN while the full payload reaches upstream.

The CVE-2026-50197 fix (commit `3152f3b0`, PR #4041, v0.26.10) substituted `expectedSize = maxBodyBytes`
only when `req.ContentLength < 0` (chunked / HTTP/2 without content-length). But when a request declares a
`Content-Length` larger than `maxBodyBytes`, `expectedSize > maxBodyBytes`, the body-extraction `if` is
skipped entirely, and `ExtractHttpBodyOptionally` returns `rawBodyBytes = nil` — so OPA evaluates an empty
`parsed_body`, while the full forbidden payload still flows to the upstream. A deny-on-presence policy
(`default allow = true; allow = false if input.parsed_body.<forbidden>`) — the exact Rego shape the
advisory describes — fails OPEN. The fix's own comment reasons only about `ContentLength == -1`; the
oversized branch was never considered, and the added PoC test only covers small bodies.

### Affected code

- `filters/openpolicyagent/openpolicyagent.go` `ExtractHttpBodyOptionally`: the
  `expectedSize <= maxBodyBytes` gate lets an oversized declared body fall through to
  `return req.Body, nil, func() {}, nil` (OPA sees an empty document).
- Corroborated by Skipper's own unit test "Read body exhausting max bytes" (`{ "welcome": "world" }`,
  `maxBodySize: 5` → `bodyInPolicy: ""`).

### Steps to reproduce

See attached `docker-compose.yml` (official `golang` image) + `setup.sh` + `exploit.sh`, which run a real
Skipper proxy (`proxytest`) with a real OPA control plane (`opasdktest`),
`WithMaxRequestBodyBytes(32)`, policy `allow = false if input.parsed_body.action == "delete"`, route
`* -> opaAuthorizeRequestWithBody("test") -> upstream`:
- `{"action":"delete"}` (19B ≤ 32) → **403** (denied).
- `{"action":"delete","pad":"X..64"}` (> 32) → **200**, upstream received the full body (BYPASS).
- small chunked `{"action":"delete"}` → **403** (positive control: the original CVE is fixed).

(Library-tier: validated via Skipper's real proxy test harness, not a deploy of the official image; benign
oracle = status diff + upstream-received body; no RCE.)

### Impact

Deployments authorizing on request-body content via `opaAuthorizeRequestWithBody` + deny-on-presence Rego
can be bypassed by inflating the request body past `-open-policy-agent-max-request-body-size` (default
1 MB); the full payload still reaches the upstream.

### Mitigation

Document how policy owners should block requests with oversized body.

Example deny by default and use "allow if" no oversized body:
```rego
default allow := false

allow if {
    input.attributes.request.http.truncated_body == false
    # ... body-based conditions
}
```

Example allow by default and use "deny if" an oversized body:
```rego
default deny := false

deny if {
    input.attributes.request.http.truncated_body == true
    # ... body-based conditions
}
```
