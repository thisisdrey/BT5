# Q0359: Loans funding and disbursement state: standing allowance / double-fund path / no stale owner

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing while the NFT has been approved, listed, cancelled, or transferred shortly before the funding call and make commitment or `alreadyFunded` checks observe an inconsistent ledger state that allows replayed funding or funding after the economic state advanced, breaking the rule that a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing
- Exploit idea: make commitment or `alreadyFunded` checks observe an inconsistent ledger state that allows replayed funding or funding after the economic state advanced
- Invariant to test: a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement
- Fast validation: Assert that any failed disbursement or replay attempt reverts without leaving priceable or withdrawable balances behind.
