# Q1010: Investor withdrawal routing: duplicate ids / wrong recipient / single claim per payable

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with duplicate, reordered, or adversarially mixed loan ids in the batch while a vault, exchange, or later counterparty relies on the same payable balances after the batch and make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans, breaking the rule that each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs and leading to Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: duplicate, reordered, or adversarially mixed loan ids in the batch
- Exploit idea: make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans
- Invariant to test: each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows
- Fast validation: Fuzz batched loan ordering and payable compositions and assert the first loan's cached recipient never bleeds into another loan improperly.
