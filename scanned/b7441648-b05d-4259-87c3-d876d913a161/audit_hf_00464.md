## Details
there is not lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused authorProfileId  
According to docs their should be lock  
Any Ethos participant may act as a ”whistleblower” to accuse another participant of inaccurate claims or unethical behavior. This accusation triggers a 24h lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused. Currently anyone can unvouch at any time
```solidity
function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
        revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }
    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);
    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
        revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }
    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
}

Attack Path  
Accused profile sees that a lot of complains going against him and unvouch all vouched funds before slashing  
authorProfileId can avoid being slashed

## Recommendation
```solidity
function pauseActions(uint authorProfileId) external onlyOwner{
    ...
}
function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant
{
    uint256 authorProfileId = IEthosProfile(
        contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
    require(!isActionsPaused(authorProfileId), "actions paused");
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
```
