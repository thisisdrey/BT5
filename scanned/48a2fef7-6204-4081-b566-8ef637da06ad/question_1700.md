# Q1700: iter-price-multi via liquidate-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `iter-price-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405` -> `iter-price-multi`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `iter-price-multi` carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed varied, and assert that the value `iter-price-multi` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
