# [H] CVE-2017-13090 wget heap smash

## Summary
Severity: High (CVSS 8.8)
Program: Internet Bug Bounty
Weakness: Classic Buffer Overflow
Reporter: jalio
State: resolved
Disclosed: 2019-11-12T23:45:27.217Z
CVE: CVE-2017-13090
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/287667

## Details
The retr.c:fd_read_body() function is called when processing OK responses. When the response is sent chunked in wget before 1.19.2, the chunk parser uses strtol() to read each chunk's length, but doesn't check that the chunk length is a non-negative number. The code then tries to read the chunk in pieces of 8192 bytes by using the MIN() macro, but ends up passing the negative chunk length to retr.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int argument, the high 32 bits of the chunk length are discarded, leaving fd_read() with a completely attacker controlled length argument. The attacker can corrupt malloc metadata after the allocated buffer.

Reproduction
To reproduce, use two terminals.  In the first terminal:
$ nc -l -p 8080 <wget-heap-smash.reply
In the second terminal:
$ wget http://127.0.0.1:8080/foo

Depending on how wget is compiled, this will either simply segfault or
complain about the heap being corrupted.
