## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: JLSEC-2025-231
Ecosystem: Julia
CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2025-11-21
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/JLSEC-2025-231
Type: osv

## Affected
- Julia: `MbedTLS_jll` — affected >=0 <2.28.1010+0

## Details
Mbed TLS before 3.6.4 allows a use-after-free in certain situations of applications that are developed in accordance with the documentation. The function `mbedtls_x509_string_to_names()` takes a head argument that is documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that the function will free that pointer; however, the function does call `mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list()` on that argument, which performs a deep free(). As a result, application code that uses this function (relying only on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory blocks that were freed, resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or double-free. In particular, the two sample programs `x509/cert_write` and `x509/cert_req` are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).
