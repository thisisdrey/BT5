# Q4384: status-multi via collateral-add: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `status-multi` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:163) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it calls `(map unwrap-status ids mask)` as a TWO-LIST map where `mask` is `uint-to-list-u64` of the bitmap, pairing each id positionally and truncating to the shorter list, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:163` -> `status-multi`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `status-multi` calls `(map unwrap-status ids mask)` as a TWO-LIST map where `mask` is `uint-to-list-u64` of the bitmap, pairing each id positionally and truncating to the shorter list. Reach it through `collateral-add` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
