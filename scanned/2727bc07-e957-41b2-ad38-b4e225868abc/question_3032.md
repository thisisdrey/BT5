# Q3032: iter-lookup-debt via repay: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `iter-lookup-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218` -> `iter-lookup-debt`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `repay` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `iter-lookup-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
