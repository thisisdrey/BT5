# Q3922: Smart account deployment and initialization: duplicate entries / init replay / predictability

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays while a second configuration attempt is made against a Safe that already ran initialization once and make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe, breaking the rule that the predicted address for a given deployer, nonce, and initializer should match exactly one controllable deployment outcome and leading to Cross-user confusion about who controls a newly deployed operational account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: duplicate owners, duplicate delegates, duplicate currencies, or duplicate recipients in attacker-chosen arrays
- Exploit idea: make `configureSmartAccount` run more than once or run in a context that was not the intended fresh Safe
- Invariant to test: the predicted address for a given deployer, nonce, and initializer should match exactly one controllable deployment outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user confusion about who controls a newly deployed operational account
- Fast validation: Check that no foreign Safe or Safe-like contract can abuse the factory's delegatecall-based initializer to install new module state.
