# [H] binder: fix freeze UAF in binder_release_work()

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2024-56554
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2024-12-27
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2024-56554
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=6.12.0 <6.12.4

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix freeze UAF in binder_release_work()

When a binder reference is cleaned up, any freeze work queued in the
associated process should also be removed. Otherwise, the reference is
freed while its ref->freeze.work is still queued in proc->work leading
to a use-after-free issue as shown by the following KASAN report:

This commit fixes the issue by ensuring any queued freeze work is removed
when cleaning up a binder reference.
