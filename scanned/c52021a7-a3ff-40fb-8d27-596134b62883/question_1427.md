# Q1427: account_not_frozen_for_authority: freeze semantics can be bypassed through an alternate user flow [a-delegated-or-migrated-authority] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker bypass the intended freeze semantics by invoking `lending_account_withdraw` with a delegated or migrated authority context on a frozen account so `account_not_frozen_for_authority` still changes a blocked account, violating `freeze semantics must block every forbidden value-moving path for the affected authority and account` and causing `High: unauthorized state mutation or bypass of safety freeze with financial effect`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `account_not_frozen_for_authority`
- Entrypoint: `lending_account_withdraw`
- Attacker controls: a delegated or migrated authority context on a frozen account
- Exploit idea: Audit alternate user flows that eventually touch the same balances but may not call the common frozen-account guard. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: freeze semantics must block every forbidden value-moving path for the affected authority and account
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unauthorized state mutation or bypass of safety freeze with financial effect
- Fast validation: Freeze the account, exercise alternate paths, and assert every value-moving route rejects before any state mutation occurs. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
