# Q3522: close_account: flag desynchronization enables forbidden transitions [an-account-with-only-dust] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `close_account` with an account with only dust-sized residual balances so `close_account` leaves flags inconsistent with real account state, violating `closing an account must never strand value or release a container that still secures live positions` and enabling `High: permanent lock or hidden exposure with real financial effect`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/marginfi_account/close.rs` / `close_account`
- Entrypoint: `close_account`
- Attacker controls: an account with only dust-sized residual balances
- Exploit idea: Audit transitions around receivership, flashloan state, frozen state, and migrated accounts for paths that set or clear only part of the state machine. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: closing an account must never strand value or release a container that still secures live positions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent lock or hidden exposure with real financial effect
- Fast validation: Execute the controlled transition and assert flags, counters, and balances remain mutually consistent before and after rollback or success. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
