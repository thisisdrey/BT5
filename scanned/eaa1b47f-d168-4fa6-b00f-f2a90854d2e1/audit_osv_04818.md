# [M] Envoy: Embedded NUL in TLS DNS SAN Truncation in the Default TLS Certificate Validator. (Auth Bypass)

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: BIT-envoy-2026-47778
Aliases: CVE-2026-47778, GHSA-f8x4-rw5x-f3r7
Ecosystem: Bitnami
Published: 2026-06-30
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-envoy-2026-47778
Type: osv

## Affected
- Bitnami: `envoy` — affected >=1.38.0 <1.38.1

## Details
Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to 1.35.11, 1.36.7, 1.37.3, and 1.38.1, a structural flaw was identified in DefaultCertValidator::verifySubjectAltName where the extracted DNS SAN string is cast to a C-style string using .c_str() before being passed to the Utility::dnsNameMatch() algorithm. If the attacker serves a certificate with a dNSName SAN containing an embedded NUL byte, the helper Utility::generalNameAsString captures the complete string including the NUL. However, when .c_str() evaluates it, implicit conversion to absl::string_view inside dnsNameMatch relies on strlen(), prematurely truncating the evaluation context. Envoy evaluates trucated string against the exact required config_san match and returns true, thereby successfully validating the string with the Nul byte for an upstream routing. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.35.11, 1.36.7, 1.37.3, and 1.38.1.
