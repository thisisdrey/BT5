# Q0159: transaction pool ordering and eviction — view_client_actor.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a burst of independently signed transactions submitted across many attacker accounts in one block, a flood of transactions from many attacker keys sized to fill the pool exactly, when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit, reach `build_chunk_execution_proof` in `chain/client/src/view_client_actor.rs` and evict honest transactions permanently or make pool ordering non-deterministic, breaking the invariant that pool admission and ordering are bounded and deterministic, leading to High - Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/client/src/view_client_actor.rs` :: `build_chunk_execution_proof`
- Entrypoint: a burst of independently signed transactions submitted across many attacker accounts in one block
- Attacker controls: a flood of transactions from many attacker keys sized to fill the pool exactly; when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit
- Exploit idea: evict honest transactions permanently or make pool ordering non-deterministic
- Invariant to test: pool admission and ordering are bounded and deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters
- Fast validation: test asserting pool bounds and ordering under a crafted flood
