# [H] ChurchCRM has an API Authorization Bypass Allows Authenticated User to Deactivate, Modify, and Spam Arbitrary Families

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-39331
Aliases: GHSA-vwh8-x823-wjc5
CVSS: 8.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2026-04-07
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-39331
Type: osv

## Details
ChurchCRM is an open-source church management system. Prior to 7.1.0, an authenticated API user can modify any family record's state without proper authorization by simply changing the {familyId} parameter in requests, regardless of whether they possess the required EditRecords privilege. /family/{familyId}/verify, /family/{familyId}/verify/url, /family/{familyId}/verify/now, /family/{familyId}/activate/{status}, and /family/{familyId}/geocode lack role-based access control, allowing users to deactivate/reactivate arbitrary families, spam verification emails, and mark families as verified and trigger geocoding. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.0.
