## Affected
- Go: `github.com/zitadel/zitadel` — affected >=4.0.0-rc.1 <4.6.3

## Details
### Summary

ZITADEL's Organization V2Beta API contains Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities that allow authenticated users with specific **administrator** roles within one organization to access and modify data belonging to **other** organizations.

### Impact

ZITADEL's Organization V2Beta API, intended for managing ZITADEL organizations, contains multiple endpoints that fail to properly authorize authenticated users. An attacker with an administrator role for a specific organization could exploit this to bypass access controls and perform unauthorized actions on other organizations within the same ZITADEL instance.

This could allow an attacker to:

- **Read** organization data, including the name, domains and metadata.
- **Manipulate** (modify) the corresponding organization data.
- **Delete** the corresponding data, up to and including the entire organization.

Note that this vulnerability is limited to organization-level data (name, domains, metadata). **No other related data (such as users, projects, applications, etc.) is affected.**

### Affected Versions

Systems running one of the following versions are affected:
- **v4.x**: `4.0.0-rc.1` through `4.6.2`

### Patches

The vulnerability has been addressed in the latest release. The patch resolves the issue by correctly validating the caller's permission against the target organization.

- v4.x: Upgrade to version [4.6.3](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v4.6.3) or later.

### Workarounds

Upgrading to a patched version is the recommended solution.

If an immediate upgrade is not possible, mitigation can be achieved by disabling the affected Organization V2Beta API endpoints (e.g., /v2beta/organizations/...) at a reverse proxy or Web Application Firewall (WAF) level.
