# Q0229: Loans create authorization: contract receiver / impersonation / canonical gate

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with an attacker-controlled contract as the proposed investor plus separate EOAs for the other roles while the target counterparty addresses are registered and unregistered across attacker-controlled books in nearby transactions and make `msg.sender` and the effective originator identity diverge so the attacker originates on behalf of another address, breaking the rule that only the canonical `address(this)` originator book should authorize loan creation and leading to Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: an attacker-controlled contract as the proposed investor plus separate EOAs for the other roles
- Exploit idea: make `msg.sender` and the effective originator identity diverge so the attacker originates on behalf of another address
- Invariant to test: only the canonical `address(this)` originator book should authorize loan creation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being minted into an unauthorized economic context that can later harm another user
- Fast validation: Build a minimal scenario where a toxic loan would later be fundable or priceable, and assert the creation step itself cannot be reached by an unprivileged caller.
