# Q3421: TrustedCalls delegate execution: shared delegate / cross-user action / per-safe auth

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with a delegate address reused across several Safes with different trust surfaces while the batch mixes several individually trusted calls with shared state implications and turn a delegate right meant for one Safe into value movement or state change affecting another user or Safe, breaking the rule that a delegate authorization should apply only to the exact Safe that granted it and leading to Protocol state corruption reached through a supposedly trusted but actually overbroad delegate surface?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: a delegate address reused across several Safes with different trust surfaces
- Exploit idea: turn a delegate right meant for one Safe into value movement or state change affecting another user or Safe
- Invariant to test: a delegate authorization should apply only to the exact Safe that granted it
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol state corruption reached through a supposedly trusted but actually overbroad delegate surface
- Fast validation: Check that a delegate of one Safe cannot drive Loans, Vault, or Exchange state as if acting for another Safe.
