# [C] OpenAM: WebAuthn Java deserialization RCE via ObjectInputFilter depth>1 bypass

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: GHSA-gf8h-gq53-288j
CVE: CVE-2026-62263
CWE: CWE-502
Ecosystem: Maven
CVSS: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N (CVSS_V4)
Published: 2026-07-24

Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Maven: `org.openidentityplatform.openam:openam-auth-webauthn` — affected >=0 <16.1.2

## Details
### Summary
The GHSA-6c99-87fr-6q7r fix wrapped WebAuthn authenticator deserialization in an `ObjectInputFilter` meant to allow only `AuthenticatorImpl`, but it short-circuits to `ALLOWED` for any object at stream `depth > 1`. Because the Java serialization filter is consulted for every class in the graph (and `depth == 1` only for the root's concrete class), the allowlist constrains only the root and leaves the entire nested graph unchecked.

### Impact
An attacker can craft a stream rooted at `AuthenticatorImpl` with an arbitrary gadget chain nested inside. The gadget's `readObject`/`readResolve` executes during `readObject()` — before the cast and before any assertion verification — enabling remote code execution when a gadget is on the classpath. The deserialization sink is reached pre-authentication via an attacker-chosen `userHandle`.
