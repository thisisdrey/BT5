## Details
# `approve()`/`safeApprove()` may revert if the current approval is not zero
## Summary

`approve()`/`safeApprove()` may revert if the current approval is not zero

## Vulnerability Detail

Calling `approve()` without first calling `approve(0)` if the current approval is non-zero will revert with some tokens, such as Tether (USDT). While Tether is known to do this, it applies to other tokens as well, which are trying to protect against [this attack vector](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit).

## Impact

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: root/contracts/token/types/Token6.sol

53:         IERC20(Token6.unwrap(self)).approve(grantee, type(uint256).max);

67:         IERC20(Token6.unwrap(self)).safeApprove(grantee, UFixed6.unwrap(amount));

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

 `safeApprove()` itself also implements this protection. Always reset the approval to zero before changing it to a new value, or use `safeIncreaseAllowance()`/`safeDecreaseAllowance()`
