## Details
# Protocol can't handle fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens could take a fee on every transfer in the future. Most notably USDT. The protocol can't handle these tokens which will result in unfulfillable orders

## Vulnerability Detail
The internal bookkeeping of the contract won't match its actual balance if a fee-on-transfer token is used.

## Impact
Either an order won't be fulfillable or the admin won't be able to withdraw their fees.

## Code Snippet
When an order is matched, the tokens are transferred to the BvbProtocol contract: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-bullvbear/blob/main/bvb-protocol/src/BvbProtocol.sol#L353-L359
```sol
// ....
        } else if(takerPrice > 0) {
            IERC20(order.asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), takerPrice);
        }
        // Retrieve Maker payment
        if (makerPrice > 0) {
            IERC20(order.asset).safeTransferFrom(order.maker, address(this), makerPrice);
        }
```

If the token takes fees, the actual balance of the contract will be less than the transferred amount.
$balance < takerPrice + makerPrice$

Part of the balance will be withdrawn by the admin (fees) and the rest will be sent to the bear when the order is settled. But, because there are not enough tokens to cover both, only 1 of them will be able to withdraw. 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the actual amount of tokens you receive after a transfer and use that for internal bookkeeping.
