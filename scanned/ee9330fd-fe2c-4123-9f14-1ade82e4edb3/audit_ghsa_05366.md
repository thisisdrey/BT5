# [M] Next.js self-hosted applications vulnerable to DoS via Image Optimizer remotePatterns configuration

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-9g9p-9gw9-jx7f
CVE: CVE-2025-59471
CWE: CWE-400, CWE-770
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-01-27
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9g9p-9gw9-jx7f
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- npm: `next` — affected >=10.0.0 <15.5.10
- npm: `next` — affected >=15.6.0-canary.0 <16.1.5

## Details
A DoS vulnerability exists in self-hosted Next.js applications that have `remotePatterns` configured for the Image Optimizer. The image optimization endpoint (`/_next/image`) loads external images entirely into memory without enforcing a maximum size limit, allowing an attacker to cause out-of-memory conditions by requesting optimization of arbitrarily large images. This vulnerability requires that `remotePatterns` is configured to allow image optimization from external domains and that the attacker can serve or control a large image on an allowed domain.

Strongly consider upgrading to 15.5.10 and 16.1.5 to reduce risk and prevent availability issues in Next applications.
