# [C] mcp-contextforge-gateway has RestrictedPython sandbox bypass via getattr builtin in python_sandbox_server

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: GHSA-xm98-3vcf-fph7
CVE: CVE-2026-53710
CWE: CWE-693, CWE-94
Ecosystem: PyPI
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (CVSS_V3)

## Affected
- PyPI: `mcp-contextforge-gateway` — affected >=0 <1.0.2

## Details
**Commit:** `f855e54d5b7bc1c91b977574a03b91eff6b86bb6`
**Component:** `mcp-servers/python/python_sandbox_server/src/python_sandbox_server/server_fastmcp.py`

## Vulnerability

RestrictedPython's sandbox in ContextForge's `python_sandbox_server` sub-project allows arbitrary Python execution via three compounding weaknesses:

1. Raw `getattr` is exposed in `safe_builtins`, bypassing `_getattr_` mediation.
2. `validate_code` checks for literal dangerous dunder strings, but the payload constructs those names at runtime.
3. The `execute_code` MCP tool can be exposed over HTTP/SSE transport with no authentication layer.

## Proof of Concept

The local PoC was executed against the real pinned sandbox code path. It constructs dunder names at runtime, walks Python's class hierarchy through the exposed `getattr`, finds `subprocess.Popen`, and executes a harmless marker command.

## Production Deployment Context

ContextForge's documentation describes registering MCP servers as gateways in a running ContextForge instance. If this sandbox server is reachable over HTTP in that pattern, any client that can reach the endpoint can submit the payload through `tools/call`.

## Impact

An attacker with access to the `python_sandbox_server` HTTP endpoint can execute OS commands with the privileges of the server process. In containerized deployments with host mounts or internal network reachability, this can become filesystem compromise or network pivoting from the gateway host.

## Suggested Fix

Remove raw `getattr` and `setattr` from `safe_builtins`, expose only policy-controlled attribute access if dynamic lookup is required, replace substring filtering with a stricter RestrictedPython policy pipeline, and add authentication to HTTP transport for all `tools/call` requests.

## Caveats

This report covers the `python_sandbox_server` sub-project. The core ContextForge gateway and proxy components are not directly affected. The Critical score assumes HTTP reachability; stdio-only deployments reduce the attack vector.
