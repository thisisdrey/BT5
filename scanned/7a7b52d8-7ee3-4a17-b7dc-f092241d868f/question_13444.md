# Q13444: Admission-to-Execution Slip in sender_idx

## Question
Can an attacker use `execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/state.rs::sender_idx` to make a transaction batch pass one execution-stage admission rule but violate the invariants assumed by a later stage, enabling unauthorized execution or invalid final state?

## Target
- File/function: execution/block-partitioner/src/v2/state.rs::sender_idx
- Entrypoint: Submit a crafted transaction or conflicting batch that reaches `sender_idx` during scheduling, execution, re-execution, or commit.
- Attacker controls: conflicting transaction batches, gas budgets, delayed-field access patterns, package publishes, and execution ordering
- Exploit idea: Look for stage-local assumptions about batches, delayed fields, or outputs that are not revalidated when state evolves.
- Invariant to test: Every stage-local assumption that affects safety must be preserved or revalidated before commit.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Unauthorized transaction execution, replay, signer confusion, signature or proof misbinding, or sequence and authorization bypass that lets an unprivileged attacker cause state transitions on behalf of another user or module context.
- Fast validation: Create staged execution tests where state changes between admission and finalization and assert all invalidated assumptions trigger safe rejection or restart.
