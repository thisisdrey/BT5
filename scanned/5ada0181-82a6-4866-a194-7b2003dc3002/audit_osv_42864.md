## Summary

Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=5.19.0 <6.1.178, >=6.2.0 <6.6.145, >=6.7.0 <6.12.97, >=6.13.0 <6.18.40, >=6.19.0 <7.1.5

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Fix missing dirty page tracking in {pte,pmd}_wrprotect()

When hardware page table walker (PTW) is enabled on LoongArch, the CPU
may set _PAGE_DIRTY directly in the page table entry during a write TLB
miss, without going through the software TLB store handler. The software
TLB store handler (tlbex.S:254) sets both _PAGE_DIRTY and_PAGE_MODIFIED
together:

    ori t0, t0, (_PAGE_VALID | _PAGE_DIRTY | _PAGE_MODIFIED)

Since hardware PTW only sets _PAGE_DIRTY, the software-only bit, i.e.
_PAGE_MODIFIED is left unchanged. This creates a window where a PTE has
_PAGE_DIRTY set (hardware knows the page is dirty) but _PAGE_MODIFIED
clear (software is unaware).

When fork()/clone() triggers copy-on-write, __copy_present_ptes() calls
pte_wrprotect(), which unconditionally clears both the _PAGE_WRITE and
_PAGE_DIRTY bits:

    pte_val(pte) &= ~(_PAGE_WRITE | _PAGE_DIRTY);

Since _PAGE_MODIFIED was never set, the dirtiness information is lost
completely. Subsequently, when memory pressure triggers page reclaim,
page_mkclean() / try_to_unmap() sees the page as clean (i.e. pte_dirty()
returns false) and the page may be freed without writeback, causing data
corruption.

Fix this by propagating the _PAGE_DIRTY bit to the _PAGE_MODIFIED bit in
both pte_wrprotect() and pmd_wrprotect() before clearing writeable bits:

    if (pte_val(pte) & _PAGE_DIRTY)
        pte_val(pte) |= _PAGE_MODIFIED;

The pmd_wrprotect() fix handles the CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE case,
where pmd entries need the same treatment.

This ensures the software dirty tracking bit (checked by pte_dirty() and
pmd_dirty(), which read both the _PAGE_DIRTY and _PAGE_MODIFIED bits) is
preserved across fork COW write-protection.

The issue was found by the LTP madvise09 test case, which exercises page
reclaim after "madvise(MADV_FREE), write and fork" operation sequence on
private anonymous mappings.
