## Details
# batchMatchOrders doesn't work if trying to fill multiple orders with native ETH

## Summary

batchMatchOrders doesn't work if trying to fill multiple orders with native ETH

## Vulnerability Detail

        if (msg.value > 0) {
            require(msg.value == takerPrice, "INVALID_ETH_VALUE");
            require(order.asset == weth, "INCOMPATIBLE_ASSET_ETH_VALUE");


            WETH(weth).deposit{value: msg.value}();

BvBProtocol::matchOrder requires that msg.value == taker price. When calling a batchMatchOrder with multiple native ETH orders the order will revert because msg.value would be the sum of all the orders.

## Impact

batchMatchOrder is incompatible with native ETH order matches

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If msg.value > 0 orders should be called with the appropriate eth value to fill them.
