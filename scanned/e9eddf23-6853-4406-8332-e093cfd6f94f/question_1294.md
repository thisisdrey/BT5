# Q1294: Loan NFT lock and nonce state: per-token approval / transition gap / epoch cleanliness

## Question
Can an unprivileged current owner, approved address, buyer, or seller using ordinary NFT actions enter through `LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom` with a normal per-token approval rather than a global operator approval while the token starts unlocked with a live owner and possibly a per-token approval and make a normal lock/unlock/transfer transition create a gap where no actor can safely use the token or its cashflow rights, breaking the rule that lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward and leading to Loans NFT being stuck or its cashflow rights becoming unavailable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansNFT.sol / lock, unlock, _update
- Entrypoint: LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom
- Attacker controls: a normal per-token approval rather than a global operator approval
- Exploit idea: make a normal lock/unlock/transfer transition create a gap where no actor can safely use the token or its cashflow rights
- Invariant to test: lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being stuck or its cashflow rights becoming unavailable
- Fast validation: Forge test per-token approvals, lock/unlock cycles, and transfers, then assert nonce, owner, and unlocker views stay in one epoch.
