# Q0269: Loans create authorization: approval race / toxic loan seed / canonical gate

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with a normal transaction ordering race around canonical originator approval and self-registration while the canonical address book already contains at least one genuinely approved originator and seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate, breaking the rule that only the canonical `address(this)` originator book should authorize loan creation and leading to Accounting issue in Loans caused by unauthorized lifecycle initialization?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: a normal transaction ordering race around canonical originator approval and self-registration
- Exploit idea: seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate
- Invariant to test: only the canonical `address(this)` originator book should authorize loan creation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans caused by unauthorized lifecycle initialization
- Fast validation: Fuzz `msg.sender`, the `originator` parameter, and address-book contents, then assert every successful create binds to a canonically approved originator only.
