# Q1605: Exchange offer lifecycle: seller inputs / lock residue / one live offer state

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline while every listed loan is locked to the exchange while the offer is live and make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone, breaking the rule that an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline
- Exploit idea: make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone
- Invariant to test: an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
