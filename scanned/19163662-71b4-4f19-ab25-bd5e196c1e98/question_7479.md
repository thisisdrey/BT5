# Q7479: Conflict Resolution Gap in dereference_mut

## Question
Can `aptos-move/block-executor/src/explicit_sync_wrapper.rs::dereference_mut` let an attacker shape read-write conflicts so one path treats them as harmless while another path commits different state, yielding invalid outputs or unauthorized transitions?

## Target
- File/function: aptos-move/block-executor/src/explicit_sync_wrapper.rs::dereference_mut
- Entrypoint: Submit a crafted transaction or conflicting batch that reaches `dereference_mut` during scheduling, execution, re-execution, or commit.
- Attacker controls: conflicting transaction batches, gas budgets, delayed-field access patterns, package publishes, and execution ordering
- Exploit idea: Exploit disagreement over which conflicts require serialization, abort, or restart.
- Invariant to test: Conflict classification must be deterministic and sufficient to preserve one canonical final state across execution modes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Consensus or safety violation, invalid state commitment, total loss of liveness, validator-crashing input, proven cryptographic break, or unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork, when triggered by unprivileged transaction, package, API, or state input rather than by malicious peers or node operators.
- Fast validation: Add tests with edge-case read-write overlaps and assert all execution modes classify and resolve the conflicts identically.
