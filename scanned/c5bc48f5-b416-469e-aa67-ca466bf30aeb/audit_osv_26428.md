## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix use-after-free of new block group that became unused

If a task creates a new block group and that block group becomes unused
before we finish its creation, at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(),
then when btrfs_mark_bg_unused() is called against the block group, we
assume that the block group is currently in the list of block groups to
reclaim, and we move it out of the list of new block groups and into the
list of unused block groups. This has two consequences:

1) We move it out of the list of new block groups associated to the
   current transaction. So the block group creation is not finished and
   if we attempt to delete the bg because it's unused, we will not find
   the block group item in the extent tree (or the new block group tree),
   its device extent items in the device tree etc, resulting in the
   deletion to fail due to the missing items;

2) We don't increment the reference count on the block group when we
   move it to the list of unused block groups, because we assumed the
   block group was on the list of block groups to reclaim, and in that
   case it already has the correct reference count. However the block
   group was on the list of new block groups, in which case no extra
   reference was taken because it's local to the current task. This
   later results in doing an extra reference count decrement when
   removing the block group from the unused list, eventually leading the
   reference count to 0.

This second case was caught when running generic/297 from fstests, which
produced the following assertion failure and stack trace:
