# Q1218: Investor withdrawal routing: epoch split / wrong recipient / single claim per payable

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with one loan from a fresh ownership epoch and one loan from a prior epoch that shares the same apparent investor or unlocker while the first loan in the batch is unlocked and fixes the recipient as the current investor and make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans, breaking the rule that each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs and leading to Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: one loan from a fresh ownership epoch and one loan from a prior epoch that shares the same apparent investor or unlocker
- Exploit idea: make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans
- Invariant to test: each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party
- Fast validation: Check that every withdrawable principal and interest balance can be claimed exactly once and never becomes unreachable after a normal epoch change.
