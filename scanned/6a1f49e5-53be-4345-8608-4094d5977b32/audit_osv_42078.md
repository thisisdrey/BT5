# [H] smb: client: restrict implied bcc[0] exemption to responses without data area

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-64448
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 8.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2026-07-25
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-64448
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=3.6.0 <5.10.261, >=5.11.0 <5.15.212, >=5.16.0 <6.1.178, >=6.2.0 <6.6.145, >=6.7.0 <6.12.96, >=6.13.0 <6.18.39, >=6.19.0 <7.1.4

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: restrict implied bcc[0] exemption to responses without data area

smb2_check_message() has a long-standing quirk that accepts a response
whose calculated length is one byte larger than the bytes actually
received ("server can return one byte more due to implied bcc[0]").
This was introduced to accommodate servers that omit the trailing bcc[0]
overlap byte when no data area is present.

However, the exemption is applied unconditionally, regardless of whether
the command actually carries a data area (has_smb2_data_area[]).  When a
response with a data area is subject to the +1 exemption, the reported
data can extend one byte beyond the bytes actually received, yet
smb2_check_message() still accepts it.  The subsequent decoder then reads
past the end of the receive buffer.  This is reachable during NEGOTIATE
and SESSION_SETUP, before the session is established.

The resulting out-of-bounds reads are visible under KASAN when mounting
against a non-conforming server; both the SPNEGO/negTokenInit and the
NTLMSSP challenge decoders are affected:

Restrict the +1 exemption to responses that have no data area, so that
it still covers the bcc[0] omission it was meant for.  When a data area
is present, the +1 discrepancy instead means the reported data length
overruns the
