# Q2058: read_value accepts input it should reject (bucket.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `read_value` in `bucket_map/src/bucket.rs` with integer fields at u64::MAX / i64::MIN so the conversion wraps or saturates, and have `read_value` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`read_value` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `bucket_map/src/bucket.rs` -> `read_value()` (around line 299)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: integer fields at u64::MAX / i64::MIN so the conversion wraps or saturates
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `read_value` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `read_value` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `read_value` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
