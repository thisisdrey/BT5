# Q4959: process-debt-asset via liquidate-multi: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`process-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761) caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761` -> `process-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `process-debt-asset` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
