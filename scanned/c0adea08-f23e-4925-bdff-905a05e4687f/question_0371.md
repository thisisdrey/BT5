# Q0371: unpack-u16 via liquidate: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `liquidate` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
