# Q3050: resolve-pyth via call-ststx-ratio: turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable p

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position? `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident, so the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and turn an accounting residue into a permanently unclosable position.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched varied, and assert that the value `resolve-pyth` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
