# Q2559: Vault async redeem flow: share batching / reserve mismatch / burned-share fairness

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with share amounts chosen to maximize rounding boundaries across several approvals while idleLiquidity is just above the approved reserve and later user activity could consume nearby balances and make totalClaimableRedeemAssets or the per-controller counters diverge from the actual reserved USDC, breaking the rule that shares burned at approval should never let a controller withdraw more assets than the approval-time NAV allowed and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: share amounts chosen to maximize rounding boundaries across several approvals
- Exploit idea: make totalClaimableRedeemAssets or the per-controller counters diverge from the actual reserved USDC
- Invariant to test: shares burned at approval should never let a controller withdraw more assets than the approval-time NAV allowed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals
- Fast validation: Fuzz operator churn around redeem claims and ensure only the current authorized controller path can consume reserved assets.
