# [M] Flowise 3.1.4 Authentication Bypass via OAuth2 Credential Refresh Endpoint

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-70636
CVSS: 6.0 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)
Published: 2026-08-06

Type: osv

## Details
Flowise through 3.1.4 contains an authentication bypass vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to access the OAuth2 credential refresh endpoint by exploiting prefix-based whitelist matching in the authentication middleware defined in packages/server/src/utils/constants.ts. Attackers can send a POST request to the oauth2-credential refresh route with a trailing credential identifier to bypass all authentication and authorization checks, triggering unauthorized OAuth token rotation against credentials belonging to any workspace and potentially disrupting dependent OAuth integrations. This is a bypass of CVE-2026-41273.
