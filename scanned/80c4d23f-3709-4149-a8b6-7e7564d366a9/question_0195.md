# Q0195: memtrie and disk trie divergence on the same update — mod.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys, an update batch mixing inserts, deletes, and squashes over one shared prefix, with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes, reach `slice` in `core/store/src/trie/mem/arena/mod.rs` and make memtrie and the disk trie compute different roots for the same batch, breaking the invariant that memtrie and disk trie are observationally identical for every update sequence, leading to Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/trie/mem/arena/mod.rs` :: `slice`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys
- Attacker controls: an update batch mixing inserts, deletes, and squashes over one shared prefix; with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes
- Exploit idea: make memtrie and the disk trie compute different roots for the same batch
- Invariant to test: memtrie and disk trie are observationally identical for every update sequence
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork
- Fast validation: differential test applying identical batches to both implementations
