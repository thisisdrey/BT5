# Q3017: Address-book role bit isolation: zero-like target / whitelist bypass / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with edge-case grantee addresses such as zero-like or contract addresses the attacker controls while a later `create` flow will read borrower, investor, or servicer bits from the chosen address book and make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present, breaking the rule that each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: edge-case grantee addresses such as zero-like or contract addresses the attacker controls
- Exploit idea: make a counterparty pass a mutual-registration gate without the exact intended role bit being present
- Invariant to test: each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules
- Fast validation: Forge test role-bit combinations and assert each downstream check accepts only the exact role and exact book intended.
