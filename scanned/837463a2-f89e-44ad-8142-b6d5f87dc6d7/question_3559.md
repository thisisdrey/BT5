# Q3559: active via collateral-remove: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
`active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), use that to make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree, violating the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), then read `active` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
