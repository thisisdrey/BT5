# [C] Out-of-bounds read/write in HTTP WebSocket upgrade via non-null-terminated Sec-WebSocket-Key

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: CVE-2026-5067
Aliases: GHSA-wgr4-9pwq-94vj
CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Type: osv

## Details
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger memory corruption in Zephyr's HTTP server WebSocket upgrade path by sending a crafted Sec-WebSocket-Key header. The HTTP/1 header parser copies the header into a fixed-size buffer using a bounded copy that does not guarantee NUL termination when the input length reaches the buffer size. During upgrade handling the buffer is copied to a local stack buffer and passed to strlen(); if no NUL exists in-bounds, strlen() reads beyond the stack buffer and subsequent concatenation with the WebSocket magic string can write out of bounds. This leads to out-of-bounds read and write on stack memory, resulting in crash (denial of service) and potentially code execution. The path is reachable when CONFIG_HTTP_SERVER_WEBSOCKET is enabled.
