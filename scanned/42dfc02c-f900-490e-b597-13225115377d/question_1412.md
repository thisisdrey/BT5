# Q1412: enqueue_set_root can be driven into unbounded work (bank_forks_controller.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `enqueue_set_root` in `runtime/src/bank_forks_controller.rs` with state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another, and make `enqueue_set_root` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `enqueue_set_root` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank_forks_controller.rs` -> `enqueue_set_root()` (around line 73)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `enqueue_set_root` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `enqueue_set_root` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `enqueue_set_root` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged remote client can send TPU/QUIC traffic or transaction packets that panic, deadlock, or unboundedly grow memory in ingress, sigverify, scheduling, or PoH, halting block production across the cluster.
