# Q3456: unpack-u16 via collateral-remove: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `unpack-u16` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
