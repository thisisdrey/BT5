# [H] n8n: Git Node fetch/pull/pushTags Operations Bypass Sandbox Path Restriction

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-gf29-4f56-r2jf
CWE: CWE-22
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N (CVSS_V4)
Published: 2026-07-22
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gf29-4f56-r2jf
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- npm: `n8n` — affected >=0 <1.123.67
- npm: `n8n` — affected >=2.32.0 <2.32.1
- npm: `n8n` — affected >=2.0.0-rc.0 <2.31.5

## Details
## Impact

Authenticated n8n users with workflow create/execute rights could use the Git node's fetch, pull, or push-tags operations to bypass the repository-path containment checks that already protected clone and push. By pointing an allowlisted remote configuration value at a local path outside the intended sandbox, an attacker could pull an arbitrary local git repository into the workspace and subsequently read its files and history. 

## Patches

The issue has been fixed in n8n versions 1.123.67, 2.31.5, and 2.32.1. Users should upgrade to one of these versions or later to remediate the vulnerability.

## Workarounds

If upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:
- Restrict n8n instance access to fully trusted users only.
- Disable the Git node by adding `n8n-nodes-base.git` to the `NODES_EXCLUDE` environment variable.

These workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term mitigation measures.
