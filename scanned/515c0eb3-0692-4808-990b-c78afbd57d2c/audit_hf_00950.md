## Details
RefinanceController._validateRefinance() does the following check for the new loan's principal:
```solidity
// principal cannot increase
if (newTerms.principal > oldLoanData.terms.principal) revert REFI_PrincipalIncrease(
    oldLoanData.terms.principal,
    newTerms.principal
);
```
This check, however, does not account for any previous partial repayments made towards the old loan. Therefore, it allows for refinancing loans where the new loan will have a higher principal than the active balance of the old loan.
The problem is that when the new loan's principal amount is more than the old loan's unrepaid amount (i.e. newPrincipalAmount > oldLoanData.balance), the borrower doesn't receive his repayment back.
For example:
- Assume that an old loan's principal is 100 USDC, and the borrower has repaid 50 USDC so far.
- For simple calculations, we assume that all fees are 0%, and that the old loan has no interest to repay.
- If we rollover into a new loan with principal as 90 USDC, the numbers in rolloverAmounts() will be:
  oldLoanPrincipal = 50
  oldInterestAmount = 0
  newPrincipalAmount = 90
  borrowerOwedForNewLoan = newPrincipalAmount = 90
  amountFromLender = newPrincipalAmount = 90
  repayAmount = oldPrincipal + oldInterestAmount = 50
- Since repayAmount > borrowerOwedForNewLoan, the logic takes the else branch that repays funds to the borrower:
  amountToBorrower = borrowerOwedForNewLoan - repayAmount = 40
After the calculations in rolloverAmounts(), the result is amountToBorrower = 40, which means the borrower should receive 40 USDC from refinanceLoan(). However, LoanCore.rollover() is called with amountToBorrower specified as 0:
```solidity
amounts.amountToOldLender,
0,
0, // amountToBorrower
```
So the borrower doesn't get his 40 USDC back. The accounting for the borrower is:
- He received 100 USDC for the old loan's principal.
- He repaid 50 USDC.
- After the loan is refinanced, he owes 90 USDC to the new lender.
Therefore, he is at a net loss of 100 - 50 - 90 = 40 USDC.

## Recommendation
Restrict the new loan's principal to the old loan's unrepaid amount:
```solidity
// principal cannot increase
if (newTerms.principal > oldLoanData.balance) revert REFI_PrincipalIncrease(
    oldLoanData.terms.principal,
    newTerms.principal
);
```
