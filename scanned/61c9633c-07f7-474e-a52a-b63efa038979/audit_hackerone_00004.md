# [M] monero:// deeplink parsing accepts tx_amount=(all) and can trigger send-all transaction mode

## Summary

## Details
## Summary

Monero GUI has two different URI ingestion paths.

QR/manual URI handling uses the canonical backend parser, but external `monero://` deeplinks are parsed by a separate QML routine in `main.qml`. That deeplink path forwards the raw `tx_amount` string into the transfer model without canonical numeric validation.

The transfer model reserves the literal string `"(all)"` as a privileged internal control value meaning "send all unlocked balance". Because the external deeplink path does not reject that sentinel, an attacker can supply a crafted URI such as:

`monero://<attacker_address>?tx_amount=(all)&tx_description=test`

and the wallet will enter the send-all transaction path for the attacker-controlled address.

## Releases Affected

Observed in the current Monero GUI source checkout corresponding to `0.18.4.6`.

Affected code paths:
- `main.qml:447-478`
- `pages/Transfer.qml:95-105`
- `pages/Transfer.qml:203-212`
- `main.qml:964-980`

Comparison path showing the stricter canonical parser:
- `src/libwalletqt/WalletManager.cpp:406-423`

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Inspect `main.qml:447-478`.
   `onUriHandler(uri)` manually parses `monero://` query parameters and forwards raw `params["tx_amount"]` into `middlePanel.transferView.sendTo(...)`.

2. Inspect `pages/Transfer.qml:95-105`.
   `fillPaymentDetails(...)` inserts the attacker-controlled amount into `recipientModel` via:
   `recipientModel.newRecipient(address, Utils.removeTrailingZeros(amount || ""))`
   There is no numeric validation here.

3. Inspect `pages/Transfer.qml:203-212`.
   `recipientModel.getAmountTotal()` treats the exact literal `"(all)"` as a special internal value and returns the wallet's unlocked balance.

4. Inspect `main.qml:964-980`.
   `handlePayment()` checks whether any recipient amount equals `"(all)"`. If so, it routes the request into:
   `currentWallet.createTransactionAllAsync(...)`
   instead of the normal numeric transaction creation path.

5. Compare this with `src/libwalletqt/WalletManager.cpp:406-423`.
   The canonical URI parser uses a typed `uint64_t amount` and converts it back to display text, which is materially stricter and does not expose the UI-only `"(all)"` sentinel as an external amount value.

6. Using those code paths, a deeplink like the following is sufficient to reach the send-all branch condition:
   `monero://<attacker_address>?tx_amount=(all)&tx_description=test`

## Observed Result

Attacker-controlled external deeplink input can reach the transaction flow as the reserved internal sentinel `"(all)"`, causing Monero GUI to prepare a send-all transfer to the attacker-controlled address.

## Expected Secure Behavior

External payment-request URIs should only accept canonical numeric amounts parsed by the backend URI parser. Reserved UI control values such as `"(all)"` should never be reachable from untrusted external input.

## Impact

A malicious payment link can be transformed from a normal payment request into a send-all request to an attacker-controlled address.

This is a transaction-integrity issue in a financial wallet. The victim still has to interact with the UI and confirm the transaction, so this is not zero-click theft, but the bug lets an attacker control whether the request is interpreted as a normal amount or as "send all unlocked balance." That materially increases the effectiveness of phishing and payment-request social engineering.
