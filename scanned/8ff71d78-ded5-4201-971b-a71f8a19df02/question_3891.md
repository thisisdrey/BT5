# Q3891: calc-multiplier-delta via redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
`calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, use that to make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree, violating the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-multiplier-delta` touches, run `redeem` with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
