# Q4323: remove-user-collateral via repay: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `repay` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `remove-user-collateral` touches, run `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
