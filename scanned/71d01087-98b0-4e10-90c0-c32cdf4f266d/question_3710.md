# Q3710: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: shared delegate / allowance replay / strict expiry

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with the same delegate address authorized on one Safe but not another Safe with similar recipients while another Safe has a similar delegate or recipient topology but no matching route and consume more than a finite allowance by exploiting repeated-call or cross-route accounting boundaries, breaking the rule that expired allowances should never authorize any further ERC20 or ERC721 movement and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: the same delegate address authorized on one Safe but not another Safe with similar recipients
- Exploit idea: consume more than a finite allowance by exploiting repeated-call or cross-route accounting boundaries
- Invariant to test: expired allowances should never authorize any further ERC20 or ERC721 movement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping
- Fast validation: Fuzz allowance expiry at the block boundary and ensure no post-expiry transfer succeeds for ERC20 or ERC721 routes.
