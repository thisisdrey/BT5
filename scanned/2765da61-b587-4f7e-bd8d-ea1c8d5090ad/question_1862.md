# Q1862: Exchange offer lifecycle: cashflow timing / lock residue / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active while every listed loan is locked to the exchange while the offer is live and make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: listed loans that accrue or collect cashflows while the offer remains active
- Exploit idea: make cancellation or acceptance leave one of the listed loans locked after the storage record is gone
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissioning for who may settle a directed offer
- Fast validation: Model cashflow accrual during an active offer and assert settlement cannot mix old storage with new economic state improperly.
