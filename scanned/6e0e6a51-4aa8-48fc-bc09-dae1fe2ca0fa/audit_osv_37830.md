# [M] Authenticated Frigate users can read the full unredacted configuration via `/api/config/raw

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-33469
Aliases: GHSA-26g3-f8g8-9ffh
CVSS: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Type: osv

## Details
Frigate is a network video recorder (NVR) with realtime local object detection for IP cameras. In version 0.17.0, an authenticated non-admin user can retrieve the full raw Frigate configuration through `/api/config/raw`. This exposes sensitive values that are intentionally redacted from `/api/config`, including camera credentials, go2rtc stream credentials, MQTT passwords, proxy secrets, and any other secrets stored in `config.yml`. This appears to be a broken access control issue introduced by the admin-by-default API refactor: `/api/config/raw_paths` is admin-only, but `/api/config/raw` is still accessible to any authenticated user. Version 0.17.1 contains a patch.
