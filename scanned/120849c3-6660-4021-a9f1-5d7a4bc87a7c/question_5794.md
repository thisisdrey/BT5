# Q5794: convert-to-shares-preview via liquidate-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `convert-to-shares-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308` -> `convert-to-shares-preview`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
