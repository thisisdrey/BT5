# Q2265: iter-price-multi via liquidate-multi: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, drive `iter-price-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405) — which carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64` — to convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction, breaking the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405` -> `iter-price-multi`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `iter-price-multi` carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `iter-price-multi` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
