Bluetooth: hci_uart: fix UAFs and race conditions in close and init paths

Vulnerabilities leading to Use-After-Free (UAF) and Null Pointer
Dereference (NPD) conditions were observed in the lifecycle management
of hci_uart.

The primary issue arises because the workqueues (init_ready and
write_work) are only flushed/cancelled if the HCI_UART_PROTO_READY
flag is set during TTY close. If a hangup occurs before setup completes,
hci_uart_tty_close() skips the teardown of these workqueues and
proceeds to free the `hu` struct. When the scheduled work executes
later, it blindly dereferences the freed `hu` struct.

Furthermore, several data races and UAFs were identified in the teardown
sequence:
1. Calling hci_uart_flush() from hci_uart_close() without effectively
   disabling write_work causes a race condition where both can concurrently
   double-free hu->tx_skb. This happens because protocol timers can
   concurrently invoke hci_uart_tx_wakeup() and requeue write_work.
2. Calling hci_free_dev(hdev) before hu->proto->close(hu) causes a UAF
   when vendor specific protocol close callbacks dereference hu->hdev.
3. In the initialization error paths, failing to take the proto_lock
   write lock before clearing PROTO_READY leads to races with active
   readers. Additionally, hci_uart_tty_receive() accesses hu->hdev
   outside the read lock, leading to UAFs if the initialization error
   path frees hdev concurrently.

Fix these synchronization and lifecycle issues by:
1. Re-ordering hci_uart_tty_close() to clear HCI_UART_PROTO_READY first,
   followed immediately by a cancel_work_sync(&hu->write_work). Clearing
   the flag locks out concurrent protocol timers from successfully invoking
   hci_uart_tx_wakeup(), effectively rendering the cancellation permanent
   and preventing the tx_skb double-free.
2. Note: Clearing PROTO_READY early causes hci_uart_close() to skip
   hu->proto->flush(). This is perfectly safe in the tty_close path
   because hu->proto->close() executes shortly after, which intrinsically
   purges all protocol SKB queues and tears down the state.
3. Relocating hu->proto->close(hu) strictly prior to hci_free_dev(hdev)
   across all close and error paths to prevent vendor-level UAFs.
4. Moving the hdev->stat.byte_rx increment in hci_uart_tty_receive()
   inside the proto_lock read-side critical section to safely synchronize
   with device unregistration.
5. Adding cancel_work_sync(&hu->write_work) to hci_uart_close() to safely
   flush the workqueue before hci_uart_flush() is invoked via the HCI core.
6. Utilizing cancel_work_sync() instead of disable_work_sync() across
   all paths to prevent permanently breaking user-space retry capabilities.
