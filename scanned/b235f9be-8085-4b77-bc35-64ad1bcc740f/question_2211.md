# Q2211: resolve-interpolation-points via collateral-remove: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-interpolation-points` touches, run `collateral-remove` with the `price-feeds` buffers, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
