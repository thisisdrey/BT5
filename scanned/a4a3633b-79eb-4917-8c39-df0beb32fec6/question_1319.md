# Q1319: Loan NFT lock and nonce state: per-token approval / epoch residue / paired state read

## Question
Can an unprivileged current owner, approved address, buyer, or seller using ordinary NFT actions enter through `LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom` with a normal per-token approval rather than a global operator approval while the token was just unlocked after a prior listing or transfer cycle and make a lock or approval residue survive into the next ownership epoch, breaking the rule that ownerAndUnlocker should never expose a mixed owner/unlocker view across epochs and leading to Bypass or corruption of downstream ownership-change checks that gate vault pricing or withdrawals?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansNFT.sol / lock, unlock, _update
- Entrypoint: LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom
- Attacker controls: a normal per-token approval rather than a global operator approval
- Exploit idea: make a lock or approval residue survive into the next ownership epoch
- Invariant to test: ownerAndUnlocker should never expose a mixed owner/unlocker view across epochs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass or corruption of downstream ownership-change checks that gate vault pricing or withdrawals
- Fast validation: Check that no normal lock or transfer sequence leaves a token or its associated withdrawal rights permanently stranded.
