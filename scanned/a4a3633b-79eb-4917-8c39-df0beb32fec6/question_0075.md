# Q0075: Loans create authorization: originator mismatch / role confusion / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with a fake `originator` parameter that names another address while the attacker remains `msg.sender` while the canonical address book already contains at least one genuinely approved originator and reuse one role approval context to satisfy a different role check and initialize a loan with unauthorized parties, breaking the rule that borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution once the unauthorized loan enters normal funding and withdrawal flows?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: a fake `originator` parameter that names another address while the attacker remains `msg.sender`
- Exploit idea: reuse one role approval context to satisfy a different role check and initialize a loan with unauthorized parties
- Invariant to test: borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution once the unauthorized loan enters normal funding and withdrawal flows
- Fast validation: Check that no combination of overlapping role addresses or registration churn lets `create` mint a usable loan NFT without canonical approval.
