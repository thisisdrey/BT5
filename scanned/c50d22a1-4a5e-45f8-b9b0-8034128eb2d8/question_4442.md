# Q4442: resolve-ststx via supply-collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `resolve-ststx` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
