# Q5342: active via borrow: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `borrow` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `active` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
