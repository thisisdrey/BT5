# Q1848: find-asset via collateral-remove-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `find-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584` -> `find-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `find-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
