# Q4106: merge-price via borrow: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `borrow` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let varied, and assert that the value `merge-price` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
