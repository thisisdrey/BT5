# Q2270: Vault async redeem flow: split owner-controller / reserve mismatch / global reserve sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses while the manager approves only part of the pending shares before later approvals and make totalClaimableRedeemAssets or the per-controller counters diverge from the actual reserved USDC, breaking the rule that totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers and leading to User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: make totalClaimableRedeemAssets or the per-controller counters diverge from the actual reserved USDC
- Invariant to test: totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Model a tight-liquidity approval followed by partial claims and assert no controller can extract more than the burned shares justified.
