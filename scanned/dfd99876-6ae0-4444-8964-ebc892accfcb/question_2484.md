# Q2484: Vault async redeem flow: partial withdraw / ratio drift / no stranded redeem

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption while idleLiquidity is just above the approved reserve and later user activity could consume nearby balances and make claimableRedeemShares and claimableRedeemAssets decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable redemption value and leading to User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption
- Exploit idea: make claimableRedeemShares and claimableRedeemAssets decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable redemption value
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Model a tight-liquidity approval followed by partial claims and assert no controller can extract more than the burned shares justified.
