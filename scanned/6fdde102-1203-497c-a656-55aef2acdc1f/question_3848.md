# Q3848: check_bounds quota accounting can be evaded (bit_vec.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `check_bounds` in `ledger/src/bit_vec.rs` with an alternate encoding of the same logical value that the check normalizes differently, and make the entry contents verified during replay disagree with the entry contents used to update the bank, so that the invariant "Every unit of resource consumed is attributed to the source that consumed it, for the whole life of the connection/batch." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `ledger/src/bit_vec.rs` -> `check_bounds()` (around line 54)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an alternate encoding of the same logical value that the check normalizes differently
- Exploit idea: Structure requests so the resource is consumed but `check_bounds`'s accounting attributes it elsewhere, to no one, or resets it.
- Invariant to test: Every unit of resource consumed is attributed to the source that consumed it, for the whole life of the connection/batch.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Drive the path from one source and assert the accounted usage matches the measured usage exactly.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply force sigverify, dedup, scheduling, or buffering work that vastly exceeds the fees ever collected, degrading the leader below true cost.
