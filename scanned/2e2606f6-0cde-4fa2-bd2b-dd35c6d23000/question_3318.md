# Q3318: TrustedCalls delegate execution: selector shape / payload extension / exact whitelist semantics

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with calldata whose first 4 bytes are trusted while the remaining payload is attacker-chosen while the trusted call eventually reaches Loans, PortfolioVault, or LoansExchange through the Safe and use trusted selector matching to smuggle attacker-chosen semantics past the intended whitelist boundary, breaking the rule that trusted-call checking should bind the exact operational semantics intended, not just the first 4 bytes in isolation and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution caused by cross-safe or cross-user execution confusion?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: calldata whose first 4 bytes are trusted while the remaining payload is attacker-chosen
- Exploit idea: use trusted selector matching to smuggle attacker-chosen semantics past the intended whitelist boundary
- Invariant to test: trusted-call checking should bind the exact operational semantics intended, not just the first 4 bytes in isolation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution caused by cross-safe or cross-user execution confusion
- Fast validation: Forge test one delegate address across multiple Safes and assert each execute path remains bound to the granting Safe only.
