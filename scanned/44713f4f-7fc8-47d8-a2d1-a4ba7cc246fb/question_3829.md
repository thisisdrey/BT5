# Q3829: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: finite allowance / expiry bypass / per-safe route binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls while another Safe has a similar delegate or recipient topology but no matching route and spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid, breaking the rule that delegate rights and allowances should bind to one exact `(safe, token-or-collection, recipient)` route only and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls
- Exploit idea: spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid
- Invariant to test: delegate rights and allowances should bind to one exact `(safe, token-or-collection, recipient)` route only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient
- Fast validation: Model repeated finite-allowance transfers and assert the stored allowance matches the exact total transferred.
