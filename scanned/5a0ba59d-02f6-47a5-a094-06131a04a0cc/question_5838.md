# Q5838: total-assets via supply-collateral-add: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `total-assets` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
