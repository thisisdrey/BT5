# Q2524: Vault async redeem flow: share batching / free asset edge / no stranded redeem

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with share amounts chosen to maximize rounding boundaries across several approvals while the manager approves only part of the pending shares before later approvals and make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side, breaking the rule that no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable redemption value and leading to Accounting issue in the vault leading to underreserved claimable redemptions?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: share amounts chosen to maximize rounding boundaries across several approvals
- Exploit idea: make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side
- Invariant to test: no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable redemption value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in the vault leading to underreserved claimable redemptions
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated redeem()/withdraw() calls against partially approved redemptions and assert reserve counters stay exact.
