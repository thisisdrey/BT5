# [M] Fleet: Unauthenticated download of in-house iOS app binaries via predictable URLs

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-q9c5-pp7m-fm2g
CWE: CWE-862
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-08-20
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q9c5-pp7m-fm2g
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/fleetdm/fleet/v4` — affected >=0 <4.87.0

## Details
### Summary

Two endpoints serving in-house iOS application packages and manifests in Fleet's enterprise tier are reachable without a hard-to-guess token in the URL, allowing an unauthenticated attacker who can reach the Fleet server to download an in-house IPA by guessing sequential title identifiers.

### Impact

By design, Apple's `InstallEnterpriseApplication` MDM command requires that the manifest URL be reachable by the managed device without a Fleet session, so these endpoints cannot enforce session-based authentication. Fleet's legacy MDM installer path mitigates this by embedding a random, hard-to-guess token in the URL; the in-house iOS app endpoints (added later) were always intended to use the same time-limited-token pattern but the mitigation was not yet in place.

The result is read-only disclosure of in-house IPA binaries and their metadata (bundle identifier, version, name) that an operator has deployed through Fleet. This is enterprise-tier only — the free tier returns `fleet.ErrMissingLicense`. There is no privilege escalation, write access, or impact on hosts not managed by Fleet.

### Workarounds

If an immediate upgrade is not possible:

- Restrict network access to the Fleet server to trusted networks, as is typical for MDM deployments.
- Remove in-house iOS apps that contain sensitive material from Fleet; in-house app IPAs are intentionally reachable by managed devices and should not be relied on as a confidential distribution channel.
- Where available, configure CloudFront URL signing for software installers to limit the validity window of issued binary URLs.
