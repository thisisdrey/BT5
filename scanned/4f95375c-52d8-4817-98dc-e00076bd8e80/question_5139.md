# Q5139: relevant via supply-collateral-add: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `relevant` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
