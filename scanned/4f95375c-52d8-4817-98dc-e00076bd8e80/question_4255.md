# Q4255: mask-pos via collateral-remove: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`mask-pos` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91) maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91` -> `mask-pos`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `mask-pos` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
