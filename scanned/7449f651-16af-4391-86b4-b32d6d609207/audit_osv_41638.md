# [C] Orval: RCE via OpenAPI path -> unescaped request-URL template literal (backtick breakout)

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: CVE-2026-62681
Aliases: GHSA-fg9p-mrxr-hvq7
CVSS: 9.0 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)
Published: 2026-08-19
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-62681
Type: osv

## Details
Orval generates type-safe JavaScript clients in TypeScript from OpenAPI v3 and Swagger v2 specifications. Prior to 8.21.0, an unescaped backtick in an OpenAPI path is emitted into request URL template literals generated for axios, fetch, react-query, and SWR clients without safe encoding. This permits attacker-controlled JavaScript to be evaluated when a generated request, URL-builder, or query-key function is called, resulting in code execution in the developer, CI, test, or application environment. The affected code is packages/core/src/getters/route.ts and route generation consumers. This issue is fixed in version 8.21.0.
