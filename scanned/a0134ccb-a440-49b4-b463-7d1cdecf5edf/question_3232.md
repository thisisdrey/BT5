# Q3232: next-index via collateral-remove: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
