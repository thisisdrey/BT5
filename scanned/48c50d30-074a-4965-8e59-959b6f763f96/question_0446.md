# Q0446: write-feeds via supply-collateral-add: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feeds` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149) convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149` -> `write-feeds`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `write-feeds` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
