# Q2434: Vault async redeem flow: partial withdraw / ratio drift / global reserve sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption while the manager approves redemptions while `lastNav` is fresh and `navStart` is idle and make claimableRedeemShares and claimableRedeemAssets decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption
- Exploit idea: make claimableRedeemShares and claimableRedeemAssets decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated redeem()/withdraw() calls against partially approved redemptions and assert reserve counters stay exact.
