# Q2915: Address-book role bit isolation: role reuse / bit confusion / precise unregister

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with the same attacker-controlled grantee registered under several Roles values in the same book while the same grantee address is intentionally present under multiple roles for legitimate reasons and make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role, breaking the rule that unregistering one role should not leave or remove unrelated role authority unexpectedly and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: the same attacker-controlled grantee registered under several Roles values in the same book
- Exploit idea: make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role
- Invariant to test: unregistering one role should not leave or remove unrelated role authority unexpectedly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules
- Fast validation: Forge test role-bit combinations and assert each downstream check accepts only the exact role and exact book intended.
