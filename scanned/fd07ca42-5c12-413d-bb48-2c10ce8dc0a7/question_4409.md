# Q4409: total-assets via transfer: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, drive `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) — which adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs — to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, breaking the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV, and cause permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `transfer` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `transfer` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
