# Q1942: Vault async deposit flow: split parties / dust strand / pending sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses while the manager approves only part of the pending assets before later approvals and strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be claimed or cancelled, breaking the rule that totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers and leading to Cross-shareholder dilution through broken async deposit accounting?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be claimed or cancelled
- Invariant to test: totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-shareholder dilution through broken async deposit accounting
- Fast validation: Inject an approval after a NAV invalidation cycle and assert the final claim never exceeds the exact approval-time price lock.
