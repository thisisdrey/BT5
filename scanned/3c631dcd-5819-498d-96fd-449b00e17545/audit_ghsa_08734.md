# [M] Keycloak: Revoked Tokens Can Remain Active When Both Realm-Level and Client-Level `notBefore` Revocation Policies are Configured

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-83c4-ffjp-mxp9
CVE: CVE-2026-8922
CWE: CWE-303
Ecosystem: Maven
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-05-19
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-83c4-ffjp-mxp9
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Maven: `org.keycloak:keycloak-services` — affected >=0

## Details
A flaw was found in Keycloak. When both realm-level and client-level `notBefore` revocation policies are configured, Keycloak's OpenID Connect (OIDC) Introspection feature fails to properly honor the realm-level policy. This allows tokens that should have been revoked to remain active, potentially leading to unauthorized access or continued session validity. This could impact the security of systems utilizing Keycloak for identity and access management.
