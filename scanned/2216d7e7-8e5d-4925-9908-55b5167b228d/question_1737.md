# Q1737: get-notional-evaluation via supply-collateral-add: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, drive `get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) — which folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-notional-evaluation` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
