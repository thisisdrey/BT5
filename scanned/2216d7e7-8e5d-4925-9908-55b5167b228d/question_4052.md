# Q4052: principal-ratio-reduction via supply-collateral-add: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `principal-ratio-reduction` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
