# Q3273: calc-utilization via borrow: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, drive `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) — which divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets — to make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist, breaking the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `borrow` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-utilization` touches, run `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
