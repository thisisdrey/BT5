# [H] Distribution: stale blob access resurrection via repo-scoped redis descriptor cache invalidation

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-f2g3-hh2r-cwgc
CVE: CVE-2026-35172
CWE: CWE-284
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-04-06
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f2g3-hh2r-cwgc
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/distribution/distribution/v3` — affected >=0 <3.1.0
- Go: `github.com/distribution/distribution` — affected >=0

## Details
## summary:
distribution can restore read access in `repo a` after an explicit delete when `storage.cache.blobdescriptor: redis` and `storage.delete.enabled: true` are both enabled. the delete path clears the shared digest descriptor but leaves stale repo-scoped membership behind, so a later `Stat` or `Get` from `repo b` repopulates the shared descriptor and makes the deleted blob readable from `repo a` again.

## Severity

HIGH

justification: this is a repo-local authorization bypass after explicit delete, with concrete confidentiality impact and no requirement for write access after the delete event. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (7.5). CWE-284.

# details

the backend access model is repository-link based: once `repo a` deletes its blob link, later reads from `repo a` should continue returning `ErrBlobUnknown` even if the same digest remains linked in `repo b`.

the issue is the split invalidation path in the redis cache backend:

1. `linkedBlobStore.Delete` calls `blobAccessController.Clear` during repository delete handling.
2. `cachedBlobStatter.Clear` forwards that invalidation into the cache layer.
3. `repositoryScopedRedisBlobDescriptorService.Clear` checks that the digest is a member of `repo a`, but then only calls `upstream.Clear`.
4. `upstream.Clear` deletes the shared digest descriptor and does not remove the digest from the repository membership set for `repo a`.
5. when `repo b` later stats or gets the same digest, the shared descriptor is recreated.
6. `repositoryScopedRedisBlobDescriptorService.Stat` for `repo a` accepts the stale membership and now trusts the repopulated shared descriptor, restoring access in the repository that already deleted its link.

this creates a revocation gap at the repository boundary. the blob is briefly inaccessible from `repo a` right after delete, which confirms the backend link was removed, and then becomes accessible again only because stale redis membership survived while a peer repository repopulated the shared descriptor.

# attack scenario

1. an operator runs distribution with `storage.cache.blobdescriptor: redis` and `storage.delete.enabled: true`.
2. the same digest exists in both `repo a` and `repo b`.
3. the operator deletes the blob from `repo a` and expects repository-local access to be revoked.
4. `repo a` correctly returns `blob unknown` immediately after the delete.
5. an anonymous or unprivileged user requests the same digest from `repo b`, which still legitimately owns it and repopulates the shared descriptor.
6. a later request for the digest from `repo a` succeeds again because stale repo-a membership was never revoked from redis.

the attached PoC is a deterministic integration harness using `miniredis` and the pinned distribution source tree.

## steps to reproduce

canonical:

```bash
unzip -q -o poc.zip -d poc
cd poc
make canonical
```

expected output:

```text
[CALLSITE_HIT]: repositoryScopedRedisBlobDescriptorService.Clear->upstream.Clear->repositoryScopedRedisBlobDescriptorService.Stat
[PROOF_MARKER]: repo_a_access_restored=true repo_a_delete_miss=true repo_b_peer_warm=true
[IMPACT_MARKER]: repo_a_post_delete_read=true confidentiality_boundary_broken=true
```

control:

```bash
unzip -q -o poc.zip -d poc
cd poc
make control
```

expected control output:

```text
[CALLSITE_HIT]: repositoryScopedRedisBlobDescriptorService.Clear->repositoryScopedRedisBlobDescriptorService.Stat
[NC_MARKER]: repo_a_access_restored=false repo_b_peer_warm=true
```

# expected vs actual

- expected: after `repo a` deletes its blob link, later reads from `repo a` should keep returning `blob unknown` even if `repo b` still references the same digest and warms cache state.
- actual: `repo a` first returns `blob unknown`, then `repo b` repopulates the shared descriptor, and `repo a` serves the deleted digest again through stale repo-scoped redis membership.

# impact

the confirmed impact is repository-local confidentiality failure after explicit delete. an operator can remove sensitive content from `repo a`, observe revocation working immediately after the delete, and still have the same content become readable from `repo a` again as soon as `repo b` refreshes the shared descriptor for that digest.

this is not a claim about global blob deletion. the bounded claim is that repository-local revocation fails, which breaks the expectation that deleting a blob link from one repository prevents further reads from that repository.

# remediation

the safest fix is to make redis invalidation revoke repo-scoped state together with the backend link deletion. in practice that means removing the digest from the repository membership set, deleting the repo-scoped descriptor hash, and keeping that cleanup atomic enough that peer-repository warming cannot restore access in the repository that already deleted its link.
