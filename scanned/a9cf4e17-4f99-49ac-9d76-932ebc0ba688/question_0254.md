# Q0254: vault-system-repay via repay: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207) convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207` -> `vault-system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal varied, and assert that the value `vault-system-repay` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
