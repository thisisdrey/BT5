# [H] x86/fpu: KVM: Set the base guest FPU uABI size to sizeof(struct kvm_xsave)

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2022-49557
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2025-02-26
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2022-49557
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=5.17.0 <5.17.13, >=5.18.0 <5.18.2

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/fpu: KVM: Set the base guest FPU uABI size to sizeof(struct kvm_xsave)

Set the starting uABI size of KVM's guest FPU to 'struct kvm_xsave',
i.e. to KVM's historical uABI size.  When saving FPU state for usersapce,
KVM (well, now the FPU) sets the FP+SSE bits in the XSAVE header even if
the host doesn't support XSAVE.  Setting the XSAVE header allows the VM
to be migrated to a host that does support XSAVE without the new host
having to handle FPU state that may or may not be compatible with XSAVE.

Setting the uABI size to the host's default size results in out-of-bounds
writes (setting the FP+SSE bits) and data corruption (that is thankfully
caught by KASAN) when running on hosts without XSAVE, e.g. on Core2 CPUs.

WARN if the default size is larger than KVM's historical uABI size; all
features that can push the FPU size beyond the historical size must be
opt-in.
