# Q1352: calc-treasury-lp-preview via liquidate-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed varied, and assert that the value `calc-treasury-lp-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
