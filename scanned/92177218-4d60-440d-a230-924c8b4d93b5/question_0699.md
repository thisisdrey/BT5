# Q0699: collateral-remove via supply-collateral-add: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `collateral-remove` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
