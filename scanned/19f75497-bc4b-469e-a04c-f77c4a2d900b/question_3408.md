# Q3408: TrustedCalls delegate execution: shared delegate / cross-user action / no cross-safe bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with a delegate address reused across several Safes with different trust surfaces while the whitelist contains the target/selector pair for a legitimate operational path and turn a delegate right meant for one Safe into value movement or state change affecting another user or Safe, breaking the rule that a delegate or batch context should never bleed authority across Safe boundaries and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of value from another Safe or user context?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: a delegate address reused across several Safes with different trust surfaces
- Exploit idea: turn a delegate right meant for one Safe into value movement or state change affecting another user or Safe
- Invariant to test: a delegate or batch context should never bleed authority across Safe boundaries
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of value from another Safe or user context
- Fast validation: Check that a delegate of one Safe cannot drive Loans, Vault, or Exchange state as if acting for another Safe.
