# Q5830: calc-utilization via deposit: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `deposit` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
