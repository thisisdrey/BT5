# [H] powerpc/pseries: Fix use after free in remove_phb_dynamic()

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2022-49196
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2025-02-26
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2022-49196
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=4.8.0 <5.15.33, >=5.16.0 <5.16.19, >=5.17.0 <5.17.2

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pseries: Fix use after free in remove_phb_dynamic()

In remove_phb_dynamic() we use &phb->io_resource, after we've called
device_unregister(&host_bridge->dev). But the unregister may have freed
phb, because pcibios_free_controller_deferred() is the release function
for the host_bridge.

If there are no outstanding references when we call device_unregister()
then phb will be freed out from under us.

This has gone mainly unnoticed, but with slub_debug and page_poison
enabled it can lead to a crash:

To avoid it, we can take a reference to the host_bridge->dev until we're
done using phb. Then when we drop the reference the phb will be freed.
