# Q3759: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: nft route / allowance replay / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances while there are several recipient routes for the same Safe and token or collection and consume more than a finite allowance by exploiting repeated-call or cross-route accounting boundaries, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances
- Exploit idea: consume more than a finite allowance by exploiting repeated-call or cross-route accounting boundaries
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts
- Fast validation: Model repeated finite-allowance transfers and assert the stored allowance matches the exact total transferred.
