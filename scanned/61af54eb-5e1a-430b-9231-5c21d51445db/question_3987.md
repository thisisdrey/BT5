# Q3987: is-healthy-with-mask via supply-collateral-add: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `amount`, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `is-healthy-with-mask` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
