## Details
### Impact

_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

A path traversal vulnerability in MinIO's `ReadMultiple` internode storage-REST
endpoint allows a caller holding the cluster root JWT to read files from
outside the configured drive roots, bounded only by the MinIO process UID.

Distributed-erasure (multi-node) MinIO deployments are impacted. Single-node
standalone deployments do not register the route and are not affected. The
attack requires an HS512 JWT signed with `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` and carrying
`accessKey = MINIO_ROOT_USER` — the same secret every peer in the cluster
holds to authenticate internode traffic, so a compromised peer or any actor in
possession of the root credential can mint one.

The `ReadMultiple` handler (`cmd/storage-rest-server.go`) decodes a msgpack
`ReadMultipleReq` body containing `Bucket`, `Prefix`, and `Files` fields and
forwards them to `xlStorage.ReadMultiple` (`cmd/xl-storage.go`) without
validation:

```go
volumeDir := pathJoin(s.drivePath, req.Bucket)          // traversal resolves here
for _, f := range req.Files {
    fullPath := pathJoin(volumeDir, req.Prefix, f)
    data, mt, err = s.readAllDataWithDMTime(ctx, req.Bucket, volumeDir, fullPath)
}
```

`pathJoin` calls `path.Clean`, which resolves `..` components and produces an
absolute path anywhere on the filesystem — it is not a root jail. The global
`setRequestValidityMiddleware` rejects `..` in `r.URL.Path` and `r.Form` but
does not inspect request bodies, so msgpack-encoded traversal bypasses it.
Sibling storage methods (`StatInfoFile`, `ReadFileHandler`, `ReadVersion`)
validate their volume argument through `s.getVolDir(volume)`, which rejects
`..`; `ReadMultiple` skips this call.

The attacker sends `POST /minio/storage/{drivePath}/v63/rmpl` with a
msgpack-encoded body carrying `../` sequences in the `Bucket` field. The
server opens the resulting path via `os.OpenFile` with `O_RDONLY|O_NOATIME`
and returns its contents in the msgpack response stream.

**Impact by deployment:**

- **Bare-metal with `User=minio` in the systemd unit** — the `O_NOATIME`
  ownership check bounds the read to files owned by the MinIO UID. Reachable
  secrets include TLS private keys, KMS/KES key material, systemd credentials,
  and data belonging to other tenants sharing the same UID on the host.
  Secrets leaked this way persist across cluster credential rotation.

- **Containerized running as UID 0** (the historical default for the official
  Docker image, `docker-compose` examples, and Helm charts without
  `securityContext.runAsNonRoot`) — the primitive escalates to arbitrary
  host-filesystem disclosure: `/etc/shadow`, `/root/**`, Kubernetes
  service-account tokens, cloud-init metadata caches.

**Affected components:** `cmd/storage-rest-server.go` (`ReadMultiple` handler),
`cmd/xl-storage.go` (`xlStorage.ReadMultiple`).

**CWE:** CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory
— 'Path Traversal')

**CVSS v4.0 Score:** 6.9 (Medium)

### Affected Versions

All MinIO releases from `RELEASE.2022-07-24T01-54-52Z` through the final
release of the minio/minio open-source project, `RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z`.

The vulnerability was introduced in commit
[`f939d1c18`](https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/f939d1c1831c71f4b1c14df6d9cd62b12ccce7a3)
("Independent Multipart Uploads",
[PR #15346](https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/15346)), which added the
`ReadMultiple` storage-REST endpoint as part of the multipart upload
redesign. The first affected release is `RELEASE.2022-07-24T01-54-52Z`.

### Patches

**Fixed in**: MinIO AIStor `RELEASE.2026-04-14T21-32-45Z` (recommended
upgrade target). The fix — which removed the `ReadMultiple` handler, the
corresponding storage-driver method, the msgpack datatypes, the REST-client
wrapper, and the route registration — first shipped in **MinIO AIStor
`RELEASE.2024-10-23T19-38-07Z`**. Every AIStor release from
`RELEASE.2024-10-23T19-38-07Z` onward is unaffected; users should upgrade to
`RELEASE.2026-04-14T21-32-45Z` or later to pick up the accumulated fixes and
improvements shipped since.

### Workarounds

- [Users of the open-source `minio/minio` project should upgrade to MinIO AIStor `RELEASE.2026-04-14T21-32-45Z` or later.](https://docs.min.io/enterprise/aistor-object-store/upgrade-aistor-server/community-edition/)

If upgrading is not immediately possible:

- **Rotate the root credential and restrict who holds it.** The exploit
  requires a JWT signed with `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`. Treat the root credential
  as the host-filesystem disclosure primitive that it is: rotate it after any
  suspected exposure, store it only in the secret manager that bootstraps the
  cluster, and do not hand it to applications or operators who only need
  object-level access.

- **Do not run the MinIO container as UID 0.** Set
  `securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true` (and a non-zero `runAsUser`) in
  Kubernetes manifests, or add `--user` to `docker run`. This reduces the
  blast radius from arbitrary host-filesystem disclosure to MinIO-UID-owned
  files only.

- **Restrict the internode storage-REST port at the network layer.** In
  distributed deployments, the storage-REST route is served on the same port
  as the S3 API by default. Where feasible, use `--internode-port` to expose
  internode traffic on a separate interface reachable only from other cluster
  peers, and block that interface from client networks.
