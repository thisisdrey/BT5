# Q0697: lib - nonce window rotation permits replay (11)

## Question
Given the wallet's nonce bitmap has just rotated `current` into `old`, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through an on-chain call that triggers nonce rotation or cleanup before a victim's request lands, replay a `RequestMessage` through `verify_request_msg` in `contracts/wallet/signatures/no-sign/src/lib.rs` across the `old`/`current` bitmap rotation driven by `timeout` and `last_cleaned_at`, breaking the invariant `the number of times one signed `RequestMessage` executes == 1` and leading to direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/wallet/signatures/no-sign/src/lib.rs](contracts/wallet/signatures/no-sign/src/lib.rs) - `verify_request_msg` (cross-check `NoPublicKey` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: an on-chain call that triggers nonce rotation or cleanup before a victim's request lands
- Attacker controls: the timing of the triggering call
- Exploit idea: A nonce recorded in `current` moves to `old` and is eventually dropped; if the message's validity window outlives the bitmap retention, the same signed request executes twice. Set-up: the wallet's nonce bitmap has just rotated `current` into `old`.
- Invariant to test: the number of times one signed `RequestMessage` executes == 1
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once
- Fast validation: Advance the sandbox clock past `2 * timeout` and resubmit a still-valid signed request; assert rejection.
