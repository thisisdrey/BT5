# [M] User can call mint() with "0" amount

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Reporter: 3agle
Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-beam-auction/blob/main/dutch-nft/src/MeritDutchAuction.sol#L128-L169
Type: audit-issue

## Details
# User can call mint() with "0" amount

## Summary
In `MeritDutchAuction::mint()`, the user can pass 0 as an argument to this function

## Vulnerability Detail
If the user passes `0` to `amount` then this function will not revert and complete its flow and emit an event at the end `Minted`

## Impact
This emitted event can mess up with the off-chain integrations

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function mint(uint256 amount) external payable {
        // Checks
        // Cache mintedBefore to save on sloads
        uint256 mintedBefore = minted;
        // Cache mintedPerAddressBefore to save on sloads
        uint256 mintedPerAddressBefore = mintedPerAddress[msg.sender];
        // Price being paid is the current price
        uint256 pricePaid = getPrice();
        // Total price being paid is the current price times the amount of NFTs
        uint256 totalPaid = pricePaid * amount;
        // Auction must have started
        require(block.timestamp >= startTime, "Auction not started");
        // Cannot mint more than the mint cap
        require(mintedBefore + amount <= MINT_CAP, "Mint cap reached");
        // Cannot mint more than the cap per address
        require(mintedPerAddressBefore + amount <= CAP_PER_ADDRESS, "Mint cap per address reached");
        // Make sure enough ETH was sent in the transaction
        require(msg.value >= totalPaid, "Insufficient funds");

        // Effects
        // Update amount minted in total
        minted += amount;
        // Update amount minted per address
        mintedPerAddress[msg.sender] += amount;
        // Update amount of ETH raised
        totalRaised += totalPaid;

        // Interactions
        for(uint256 i = 0; i < amount; i++) {
            // Mint the amount of NFTs to the sender
            nft.mint(mintedBefore + i + 1, msg.sender);
        }

        if(msg.value > totalPaid) {
            // If too much ETH was sent, refund the difference
            (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: msg.value - totalPaid}(bytes(""));
            require(success, "Refund failed");
        }

        // Emit event for offchain integrations
        emit Minted(msg.sender, amount, pricePaid);
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend adding a check to ensure `amount>0`
```solidity
require(amount>0,"Amount must be greater than 0")
```
