# Q0507: update_bank_forks_and_poh_recorder_for_new_tpu_bank is not deterministic across nodes (banking_stage.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `update_bank_forks_and_poh_recorder_for_new_tpu_bank` in `core/src/banking_stage.rs` with state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another, and make the entry contents verified during replay disagree with the entry contents used to update the bank, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `update_bank_forks_and_poh_recorder_for_new_tpu_bank` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/banking_stage.rs` -> `update_bank_forks_and_poh_recorder_for_new_tpu_bank()` (around line 781)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another
- Exploit idea: Find input to `update_bank_forks_and_poh_recorder_for_new_tpu_bank` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `update_bank_forks_and_poh_recorder_for_new_tpu_bank` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `update_bank_forks_and_poh_recorder_for_new_tpu_bank` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
