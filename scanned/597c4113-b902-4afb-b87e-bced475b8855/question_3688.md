# Q3688: get-egroup via liquidate-multi: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch reach `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
