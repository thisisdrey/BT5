# Q2203: Vault async deposit flow: repeat approvals / price-lock break / approved price

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with a controller that is approved in several partial chunks across time while the manager approves only part of the pending assets before later approvals and make the shares claimed exceed the approval-time price lock for the same controller, breaking the rule that approved deposit shares should never exceed assets * totalSupply / approvalNAV for that exact approval epoch and leading to User funds stuck because approved deposits become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: a controller that is approved in several partial chunks across time
- Exploit idea: make the shares claimed exceed the approval-time price lock for the same controller
- Invariant to test: approved deposit shares should never exceed assets * totalSupply / approvalNAV for that exact approval epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved deposits become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Simulate partial approvals across time and assert claimable assets and shares can always be fully exhausted without dust-locking value.
