# Q0640: create via supply-collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
