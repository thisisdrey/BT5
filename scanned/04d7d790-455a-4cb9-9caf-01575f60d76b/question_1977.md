# Q1977: borsh - timestamp conversion overflow or negative deadline (2)

## Question
Given the nonce word for the target 248-bit prefix already carries a bit committed by an earlier intent, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through re-submission of a payload the attacker observed on-chain or in a public relayer mempool, supply a `deadline` to `TimestampMilliSeconds` in `crates/primitives/time/src/borsh.rs` that overflows or wraps the `i64`/`u64` nanosecond conversion so the expiry comparison inverts, breaking the invariant `an intent past its deadline never executes, for every representable `deadline`` and leading to direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/primitives/time/src/borsh.rs](crates/primitives/time/src/borsh.rs) - `TimestampMilliSeconds` (cross-check `TimestampMicroSeconds` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: re-submission of a payload the attacker observed on-chain or in a public relayer mempool
- Attacker controls: when and how many times the observed payload is replayed, and the block timestamp it lands in
- Exploit idea: Target `TimestampNanoSeconds` borsh/serde conversion at `i64::MIN`, `i64::MAX`, and negative values reachable from a signed payload. Set-up: the nonce word for the target 248-bit prefix already carries a bit committed by an earlier intent.
- Invariant to test: an intent past its deadline never executes, for every representable `deadline`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds via replay: one signed payload settles more than once
- Fast validation: Property-test the `Timestamp` conversion over extreme values; assert `has_expired()` is monotone.
