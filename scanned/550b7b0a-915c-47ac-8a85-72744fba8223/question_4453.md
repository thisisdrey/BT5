# Q4453: vault-socialize-debt via liquidate-multi: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `vault-socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216) — which routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults — to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, breaking the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216` -> `vault-socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `vault-socialize-debt` routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, then read `vault-socialize-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
