Hi,

There's an arbitrary file read vulnerability present in openssl s_server when ran on Windows with the -WWW or -HTTP option. To reproduce:

* run `openssl s_server -tls1 -WWW -accept 443`
* run `.\curl.exe -k https://127.0.0.1/..\..\..\..\..\..\..\any-file`
* observe the contents of any-file, which could be located outside of the running directory, to be returned to the user

The root cause of this vulnerability seems to come from an incomplete check in path parsing logic: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/apps/s_server.c#L3225. Ideally, it'd include a check for a backslash, too. It seems that this particular code has been around for some time.

Vulnerable versions seem to include 0.9.6, 0.9.7, 0.9.8, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1.0, and 1.1.1.

This was tested against OpenSSL 1.1.1c on Windows 10 (64-bit).

The maintainers fixed this in [this commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/0a4d6c67480a4d2fce514e08d3efe571f2ee99c9):

## Impact

An attacker may be able to read arbitrary files from a user's file system.
