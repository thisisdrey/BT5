# Q3364: TrustedCalls delegate execution: batch order / safe confusion / no cross-safe bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with the order of several batched trusted calls that share state across the same Safe or target while another Safe in the system has different delegates or target trust expectations and make a delegate of one Safe execute a call from another Safe or another trust context, breaking the rule that a delegate or batch context should never bleed authority across Safe boundaries and leading to Protocol state corruption reached through a supposedly trusted but actually overbroad delegate surface?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: the order of several batched trusted calls that share state across the same Safe or target
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe execute a call from another Safe or another trust context
- Invariant to test: a delegate or batch context should never bleed authority across Safe boundaries
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol state corruption reached through a supposedly trusted but actually overbroad delegate surface
- Fast validation: Fuzz trusted selectors with attacker-chosen trailing calldata and ensure the whitelist boundary cannot be widened by payload shape alone.
