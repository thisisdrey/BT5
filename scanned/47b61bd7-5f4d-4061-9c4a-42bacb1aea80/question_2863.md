# Q2863: relevant via repay: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `repay` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), then read `relevant` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
