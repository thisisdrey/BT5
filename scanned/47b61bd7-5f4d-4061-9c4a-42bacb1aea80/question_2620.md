# Q2620: accrue-and-cache via collateral-add: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls call ordering within the block reach `accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with call ordering within the block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
