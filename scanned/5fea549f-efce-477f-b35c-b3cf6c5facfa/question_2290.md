# Q2290: merkle proof verification on malformed paths — merkle_proof.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `query` / `call_function` view request on a public RPC node, a proof with duplicated, reordered, or over-long path elements, with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes, reach `compute_past_block_proof_in_merkle_tree_of_later_block` in `core/store/src/merkle_proof.rs` and have a forged proof verify against an honest root, breaking the invariant that merkle path verification binds length, order, and direction of every step, leading to High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/merkle_proof.rs` :: `compute_past_block_proof_in_merkle_tree_of_later_block`
- Entrypoint: a `query` / `call_function` view request on a public RPC node
- Attacker controls: a proof with duplicated, reordered, or over-long path elements; with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes
- Exploit idea: have a forged proof verify against an honest root
- Invariant to test: merkle path verification binds length, order, and direction of every step
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass
- Fast validation: unit test over malformed proof paths
