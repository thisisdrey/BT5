# Q4889: vault-accrue via liquidate-redeem: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, drive `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) — which dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id — to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, breaking the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
