# Q2312: resolve-dia via liquidate: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `liquidate` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `collateral-receiver` varied, and assert that the value `resolve-dia` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
