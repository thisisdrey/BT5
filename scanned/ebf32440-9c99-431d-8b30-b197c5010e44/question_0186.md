# Q0186: resolve-dia via supply-collateral-add: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, so the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `resolve-dia` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
