# Q2588: filter-out-debt-asset via collateral-remove: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) reach `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) varied, and assert that the value `filter-out-debt-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
