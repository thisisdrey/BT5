# Q3575: collateral-remove via liquidate: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
`collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `debt-amount`, use that to make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree, violating the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `liquidate` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `debt-amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
