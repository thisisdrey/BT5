# Vulnerability details

There are ERC20 tokens that charge fee for every `transfer()` / `transferFrom()`.

`Vault.sol#addValue()` assumes that the received amount is the same as the transfer amount, and uses it to calculate attributions, balance amounts, etc. While the actual transferred amount can be lower for those tokens.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-insure/blob/19d1a7819fe7ce795e6d4814e7ddf8b8e1323df3/contracts/Vault.sol#L124-L140

```solidity
function addValue(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _from,
    address _beneficiary
) external override onlyMarket returns (uint256 _attributions) {

    if (totalAttributions == 0) {
        _attributions = _amount;
    } else {
        uint256 _pool = valueAll();
        _attributions = (_amount * totalAttributions) / _pool;
    }
    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
    balance += _amount;
    totalAttributions += _attributions;
    attributions[_beneficiary] += _attributions;
}
```

### Recommendation

Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount.
