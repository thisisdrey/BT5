# Q0579: add-user-collateral via liquidate-redeem: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the vault whose share price the redemption moves, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `add-user-collateral` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
