# Q1616: get_precompile_signature_details accepts input it should reject (signature_details.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `get_precompile_signature_details` in `runtime-transaction/src/signature_details.rs` with a boundary value exactly on the accept/reject edge of the predicate, and have `get_precompile_signature_details` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`get_precompile_signature_details` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/signature_details.rs` -> `get_precompile_signature_details()` (around line 61)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a boundary value exactly on the accept/reject edge of the predicate
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `get_precompile_signature_details` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `get_precompile_signature_details` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `get_precompile_signature_details` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
