# Q2911: get_current_instruction_context can persist state that blocks later replay (transaction.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `get_current_instruction_context` in `transaction-context/src/transaction.rs` with the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices, and commit state through `get_current_instruction_context` that a later load or restart refuses to accept, so that the invariant "Any state this path can commit is loadable by the same version on restart." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-context/src/transaction.rs` -> `get_current_instruction_context()` (around line 263)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices
- Exploit idea: Commit account/ledger state through `get_current_instruction_context` that a later load rejects, so every node fails replay after restart and needs manual intervention.
- Invariant to test: Any state this path can commit is loadable by the same version on restart.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Write the crafted state, restart the bank from it in a test, and assert replay completes.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged remote client can send TPU/QUIC traffic or transaction packets that panic, deadlock, or unboundedly grow memory in ingress, sigverify, scheduling, or PoH, halting block production across the cluster.
