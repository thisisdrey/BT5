## Details
**Repository:** [`monero-project/monero`](https://github.com/monero-project/monero) — `src/wallet/wallet2.cpp`, `src/ringct/rctSigs.cpp`. Snapshot: `master @ 3ad4a5ee8` (`v0.18.1.0-3ad4a5ee8`).

## Summary

`wallet2::check_reserve_proof` proves that a reserve-proof entry belongs to the claimed wallet, then decodes the RingCT amount from `tx.rct_signatures.ecdhInfo[proof.index_in_tx]` and adds it to `total`. The missing step is the one normal wallet decoding already does: recompute the Pedersen commitment from the decoded `(mask, amount)` and compare it to `tx.rct_signatures.outPk[n].mask`.

The vulnerable block is in `wallet2.cpp` around 12751–12764:

```cpp
uint64_t amount = tx.vout[proof.index_in_tx].amount;
if (amount == 0)
{
  crypto::secret_key shared_secret;
  crypto::derivation_to_scalar(derivation, proof.index_in_tx, shared_secret);
  rct::ecdhTuple ecdh_info = tx.rct_signatures.ecdhInfo[proof.index_in_tx];
  rct::ecdhDecode(ecdh_info, rct::sk2rct(shared_secret),
      tx.rct_signatures.type == rct::RCTTypeBulletproof2 ||
      tx.rct_signatures.type == rct::RCTTypeCLSAG ||
      tx.rct_signatures.type == rct::RCTTypeBulletproofPlus);
  amount = rct::h2d(ecdh_info.amount);   // no C == mask*G + amount*H check
}
total += amount;
```

For comparison, the wallet receive path does not trust that decoded value by itself:

```cpp
const rct::key C = tx.rct_signatures.outPk[n].mask;
rct::key Ctmp;
rct::addKeys2(Ctmp, ecdh_info.mask, ecdh_info.amount, rct::H);
if (rct::equalKeys(C, Ctmp))
  amount = rct::h2d(ecdh_info.amount);
else
  amount = 0;
```

The lower-level RingCT helper is stricter too. `decodeRctSimple()` throws `warning, amount decoded incorrectly, will be unable to spend` when the decoded ECDH tuple does not match the output commitment.

That leaves reserve proof verification on the weaker path: it authenticates ownership of the output, but it does not authenticate the amount it just decoded. A malicious prover wants exactly that gap: a proof verifier that reads attacker-controlled amount metadata and never binds it back to the commitment that consensus actually checked.

## Releases Affected

Confirmed on `master @ 3ad4a5ee8` (`Monero 'Fluorine Fermi' v0.18.1.0-3ad4a5ee8`) by source review and a targeted unit test.

The bug is not tied to a recent refactor. Any branch with this `check_reserve_proof` amount path is worth checking, especially branches after RingCT reserve proofs were added.

## Steps to Reproduce

Add the following unit test under `tests/unit_tests/ringct.cpp` (this is the checked proof I used; it does not touch `wallet2.cpp` or the reserve-proof verifier):

```cpp
TEST(ringct, reserveProofStyleDecodeNeedsCommitmentCheck)
{
  static constexpr uint64_t real_amount = 1;
  static constexpr uint64_t fake_amount = 1000000000000;

  const rct::key amount_key = rct::skGen();
  const rct::key commitment_mask = rct::genCommitmentMask(amount_key);
  rct::key output_commitment;
  rct::addKeys2(output_commitment, commitment_mask, rct::d2h(real_amount), rct::H);

  rct::ecdhTuple encoded = {};
  encoded.amount = rct::d2h(fake_amount);
  rct::ecdhEncode(encoded, amount_key, true);

  rct::ecdhTuple reserve_proof_style_decode = encoded;
  rct::ecdhDecode(reserve_proof_style_decode, amount_key, true);
  ASSERT_EQ(fake_amount, rct::h2d(reserve_proof_style_decode.amount));

  rct::key recomputed_commitment;
  rct::addKeys2(recomputed_commitment, reserve_proof_style_decode.mask,
      reserve_proof_style_decode.amount, rct::H);
  ASSERT_NE(output_commitment, recomputed_commitment);

  rct::rctSig rv;
  rv.type = rct::RCTTypeCLSAG;
  rv.ecdhInfo.push_back(encoded);
  rv.outPk.push_back({});
  rv.outPk[0].mask = output_commitment;

  rct::key decoded_mask;
  EXPECT_THROW(
    (void)rct::decodeRctSimple(rv, amount_key, 0, decoded_mask, hw::get_device("default")),
    std::runtime_error
  );
}
```

Build and run only that test:

```bash
cmake -S /home/beni/Monero/monero -B /tmp/monero-official-build \
  -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D BUILD_TESTS=ON -D MANUAL_SUBMODULES=1
cmake --build /tmp/monero-official-build -j"$(nproc)" --target unit_tests

/tmp/monero-official-build/tests/unit_tests/unit_tests \
  --gtest_filter=ringct.reserveProofStyleDecodeNeedsCommitmentCheck
```

Observed output:

What the test proves:

1. The ECDH metadata can decode to `fake_amount = 1000000000000`.
2. That decoded amount does not match the real output commitment for `real_amount = 1`.
3. The normal RingCT decode helper catches the mismatch.
4. A verifier that only does `ecdhDecode()` + `h2d()` and then sums the result is missing the decisive check.

That last line is exactly what `check_reserve_proof` does today.

## Possible Solution

Use the same commitment check in `check_reserve_proof` that the wallet receive path and `decodeRctSimple()` already use.

Minimal patch shape inside the RingCT amount branch:

```cpp
crypto::secret_key shared_secret;
crypto::derivation_to_scalar(derivation, proof.index_in_tx, shared_secret);

rct::ecdhTuple ecdh_info = tx.rct_signatures.ecdhInfo[proof.index_in_tx];
const bool v2 =
    tx.rct_signatures.type == rct::RCTTypeBulletproof2 ||
    tx.rct_signatures.type == rct::RCTTypeCLSAG ||
    tx.rct_signatures.type == rct::RCTTypeBulletproofPlus;
rct::ecdhDecode(ecdh_info, rct::sk2rct(shared_secret), v2);

THROW_WALLET_EXCEPTION_IF(sc_check(ecdh_info.mask.bytes) != 0,
    error::wallet_internal_error, "Bad ECDH input mask");
THROW_WALLET_EXCEPTION_IF(sc_check(ecdh_info.amount.bytes) != 0,
    error::wallet_internal_error, "Bad ECDH input amount");

rct::key Ctmp;
rct::addKeys2(Ctmp, ecdh_info.mask, ecdh_info.amount, rct::H);
if (!rct::equalKeys(tx.rct_signatures.outPk[proof.index_in_tx].mask, Ctmp))
  return false;

amount = rct::h2d(ecdh_info.amount);
```

Add a regression test close to the unit test above, and ideally a wallet-level test once there is a small helper for building a reserve proof around a deliberately malformed output.

This should be fixed alongside the duplicate-entry issue in `check_reserve_proof`: reject duplicate key images and duplicate `(txid, index_in_tx)` entries before fetching transactions or summing amounts.

## Impact

If an attacker can get a confirmed output plus reserve proof into this shape, the official verifier can report reserves that are larger than the commitment-backed amount on-chain. The business impact is not wallet theft; it is false solvency. An exchange, bridge custodian, lender, OTC desk, or auditor relying on `check_reserve_proof` could accept collateral or reserves that do not exist.

The current evidence is the unit test above, not an end-to-end network exploit. I would not present it as "one-command theft" or as a finished exploit. The right framing is narrower: the reserve-proof verifier uses a weaker amount-decoding path than the wallet itself, and the test shows why the commitment check exists elsewhere in the codebase.
