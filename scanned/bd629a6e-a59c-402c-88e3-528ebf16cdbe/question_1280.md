# Q1280: Investor withdrawal routing: epoch split / stuck route / no stale unlocker

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with one loan from a fresh ownership epoch and one loan from a prior epoch that shares the same apparent investor or unlocker while a vault, exchange, or later counterparty relies on the same payable balances after the batch and make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary, breaking the rule that a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch and leading to Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: one loan from a fresh ownership epoch and one loan from a prior epoch that shares the same apparent investor or unlocker
- Exploit idea: make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary
- Invariant to test: a cleared or changed lock should never preserve withdrawal rights into the next epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party
- Fast validation: Model sale-offer settlement or cancellation around `investorWithdraw` and assert no stale unlocker or stale owner can claim old payables.
