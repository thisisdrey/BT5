# Q5135: receive-underlying via deposit: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
`receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) pulls the underlying from a named account. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, use that to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, violating the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `deposit` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `deposit` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
