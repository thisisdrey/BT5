# Q2000: set_max_age can deadlock or livelock the node (blockhash_queue.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `set_max_age` in `accounts-db/src/blockhash_queue.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and hold two of the locks `set_max_age` touches in an order that stalls forward progress, so that the invariant "Locks in `set_max_age` are always acquired in a total order and released on every path, including error paths." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/blockhash_queue.rs` -> `set_max_age()` (around line 158)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Create a lock/channel ordering through `set_max_age` that two attacker transactions can hold simultaneously, stalling banking or replay indefinitely.
- Invariant to test: Locks in `set_max_age` are always acquired in a total order and released on every path, including error paths.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Loom or stress test the concurrent path; assert forward progress under adversarial interleavings.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged remote client can send TPU/QUIC traffic or transaction packets that panic, deadlock, or unboundedly grow memory in ingress, sigverify, scheduling, or PoH, halting block production across the cluster.
