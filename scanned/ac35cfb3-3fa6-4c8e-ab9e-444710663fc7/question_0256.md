# Q0256: Loans create authorization: contract receiver / toxic loan seed / downstream safety

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with an attacker-controlled contract as the proposed investor plus separate EOAs for the other roles while a victim investor or vault could later interact with the created loan through funding, withdrawal, or pricing flows and seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate, breaking the rule that an unprivileged caller should never be able to create a loan whose later funding, withdrawal, or pricing can touch another user without a real originator approval and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and role-based access control?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: an attacker-controlled contract as the proposed investor plus separate EOAs for the other roles
- Exploit idea: seed a loan that looks valid on-chain even though the attacker never passed the intended canonical-originator gate
- Invariant to test: an unprivileged caller should never be able to create a loan whose later funding, withdrawal, or pricing can touch another user without a real originator approval
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and role-based access control
- Fast validation: Build a minimal scenario where a toxic loan would later be fundable or priceable, and assert the creation step itself cannot be reached by an unprivileged caller.
