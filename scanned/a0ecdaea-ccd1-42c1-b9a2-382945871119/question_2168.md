# Q2168: ms_per_age is not deterministic across nodes (stats.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `ms_per_age` in `accounts-db/src/accounts_index/stats.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make the accounts lt-hash accumulated for the slot disagree with the account set actually committed in that slot, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `ms_per_age` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/accounts_index/stats.rs` -> `ms_per_age()` (around line 131)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Find input to `ms_per_age` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `ms_per_age` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `ms_per_age` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
