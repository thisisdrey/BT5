# Q3358: TrustedCalls delegate execution: batch order / cross-user action / exact whitelist semantics

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with the order of several batched trusted calls that share state across the same Safe or target while the batch mixes several individually trusted calls with shared state implications and turn a delegate right meant for one Safe into value movement or state change affecting another user or Safe, breaking the rule that trusted-call checking should bind the exact operational semantics intended, not just the first 4 bytes in isolation and leading to Protocol state corruption reached through a supposedly trusted but actually overbroad delegate surface?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: the order of several batched trusted calls that share state across the same Safe or target
- Exploit idea: turn a delegate right meant for one Safe into value movement or state change affecting another user or Safe
- Invariant to test: trusted-call checking should bind the exact operational semantics intended, not just the first 4 bytes in isolation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Protocol state corruption reached through a supposedly trusted but actually overbroad delegate surface
- Fast validation: Check that a delegate of one Safe cannot drive Loans, Vault, or Exchange state as if acting for another Safe.
