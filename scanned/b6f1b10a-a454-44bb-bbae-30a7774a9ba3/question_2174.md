# Q2174: Vault async deposit flow: partial claim / counter divergence / pending sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with alternating deposit() and mint() claims against the same claimable position while a holdings or ledger change zeroes `lastNavUpdate` between request and the next approval cycle and make totalPendingDepositAssets or the per-controller claimable counters diverge from what the vault actually owes, breaking the rule that totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers and leading to Accounting issue in the vault leading to underbacked claimable shares?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: alternating deposit() and mint() claims against the same claimable position
- Exploit idea: make totalPendingDepositAssets or the per-controller claimable counters diverge from what the vault actually owes
- Invariant to test: totalPendingDepositAssets should always equal the sum of pendingDepositAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in the vault leading to underbacked claimable shares
- Fast validation: Forge test two requests plus multiple partial approvals, then claim in alternating asset and share units and assert counter conservation.
