# Q4128: interest-rate via redeem: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-out` reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `redeem` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-out` across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `interest-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
