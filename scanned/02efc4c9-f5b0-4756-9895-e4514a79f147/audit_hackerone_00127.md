## Impact

An attacker can takeover the github repository and host malicious code on it. When any user will follow the setup steps and clone the repository, it will end up pulling code from attacker's controlled repository.
When user will try running further setup steps, it will end up executing attackers malicious code, which can lead to RCE.
