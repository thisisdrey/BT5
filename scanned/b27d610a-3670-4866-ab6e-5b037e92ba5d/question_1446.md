# Q1446: add-user-collateral via transfer: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, can an unprivileged attacker make `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `transfer` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `add-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
