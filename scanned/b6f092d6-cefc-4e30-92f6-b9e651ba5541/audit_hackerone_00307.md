## Details
Hi, 

I found an off-by-one in Exim MTA utility function. It was reported to exim and official patch has been released, assigned CVE-2018-6789. This bug affects all versions of exim.

This bug is simple, but can be leverage to gain remote code execution, using skillful heap exploitation. Details are here: https://devco.re/blog/2018/03/06/exim-off-by-one-RCE-exploiting-CVE-2018-6789-en/

I believe exim is widespread enough and it seems to fit all criteria. I wonder if this finding worths a bounty, or the reason why it is not included. Thanks!
