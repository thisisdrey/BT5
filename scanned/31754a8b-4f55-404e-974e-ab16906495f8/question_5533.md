# Q5533: bandwidth scheduler interaction with resharding — deterministic_account_id.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`, traffic saturating links across the exact block where the shard layout changes, when links are saturated across the exact resharding block, and additionally when the interaction crosses a protocol-version upgrade with receipts in flight, reach `version` in `core/primitives-core/src/deterministic_account_id.rs` and carry grants addressed to shard ids that no longer exist, stalling links permanently, breaking the invariant that scheduler state is remapped consistently at every layout change, leading to Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives-core/src/deterministic_account_id.rs` :: `version`
- Entrypoint: an attacker contract emitting cross-shard promises with `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight`
- Attacker controls: traffic saturating links across the exact block where the shard layout changes; when links are saturated across the exact resharding block; when the interaction crosses a protocol-version upgrade with receipts in flight
- Exploit idea: carry grants addressed to shard ids that no longer exist, stalling links permanently
- Invariant to test: scheduler state is remapped consistently at every layout change
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)
- Fast validation: test-loop test saturating links across a resharding boundary
