The warning is due to the FUSE_NOTIFY_RESEND notify sent by the write()
syscall in the reproducer program and it happens as follows:

(1) calls fuse_dev_read() to read the INIT request
The read succeeds. During the read, bit FR_SENT will be set on the
request.
(2) calls fuse_dev_write() to send an USE_NOTIFY_RESEND notify
The resend notify will resend all processing requests, so the INIT
request is moved from processing list to pending list again.
(3) calls fuse_dev_read() with an invalid output address
fuse_dev_read() will try to copy the same INIT request to the output
address, but it will fail due to the invalid address, so the INIT
request is ended and triggers the warning in fuse_request_end().

Fix it by clearing FR_SENT when re-adding requests into pending list.
