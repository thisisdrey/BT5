# Q2684: Vault NAV freshness and cross-contract state: external buyout / underbacked claim / no stale claims

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower, investor, buyer, seller, or shareholder interacting through ordinary protocol entrypoints enter through `Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals` with acceptance timing for a vault-created sale offer by an attacker-controlled designated buyer while the affected loan is in or near the curated `_navLoanIds` set used for pricing and make a shareholder claim rely on a NAV snapshot that omitted or double-counted user-controlled value, breaking the rule that an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone and leading to Accounting issue in the vault leading to underbacked claims or mispriced shares?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / _requireFreshNav, updateNav, collectCashflows, fundLoans, createSaleOffer, acceptSaleOffer
- Entrypoint: Unprivileged user actions that change vault-owned loan state before manager approvals
- Attacker controls: acceptance timing for a vault-created sale offer by an attacker-controlled designated buyer
- Exploit idea: make a shareholder claim rely on a NAV snapshot that omitted or double-counted user-controlled value
- Invariant to test: an unprivileged counterparty should never be able to force underpriced or overpriced vault claims through timing alone
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in the vault leading to underbacked claims or mispriced shares
- Fast validation: Model borrower payments and external offer settlements right before manager approvals and assert no stale snapshot remains usable.
