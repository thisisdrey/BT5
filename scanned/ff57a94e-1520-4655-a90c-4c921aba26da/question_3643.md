# Q3643: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: expiry edge / route widening / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries while another Safe has a similar delegate or recipient topology but no matching route and spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: transfer timing exactly around allowance expiry boundaries
- Exploit idea: spend to a recipient or token/collection route that was never approved for that Safe
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of assets from another Safe or to an unapproved recipient
- Fast validation: Model repeated finite-allowance transfers and assert the stored allowance matches the exact total transferred.
