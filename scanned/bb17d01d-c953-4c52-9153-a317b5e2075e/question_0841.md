# Q0841: reclaim_bounty_funds can act on stale metadata ownership

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `reclaim_bounty_funds` after the underlying governance object changed lifecycle stage and still mutate or clear metadata they should no longer control?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/bounties/src/lib.rs::reclaim_bounty_funds
- Entrypoint: signed extrinsic `reclaim_bounty_funds`
- Attacker controls: call repetition, batching order, and surrounding state
- Exploit idea: Test owner binding across closure, cancellation, execution, and index reuse.
- Invariant to test: Metadata authority must expire exactly when the referenced governance object does.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized treasury, bounty, or governance outcome with financial impact
- Fast validation: Drive the object through each lifecycle transition and immediately attempt metadata mutation or clearing from every previously-valid actor.
