# Q1616: normalize-pyth via liquidate-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `normalize-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297` -> `normalize-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `normalize-pyth` computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed varied, and assert that the value `normalize-pyth` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
