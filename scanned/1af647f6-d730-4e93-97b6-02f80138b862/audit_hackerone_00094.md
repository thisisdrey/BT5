## Details
## Summary:
Hi consensys Security Team.

I have found CSV Injection when generate report at https://assets-paris-demo.codefi.network/

CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites embed untrusted input inside CSV files.
When a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc is used to open a CSV, any cells starting with = will be interpreted by the software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used for three key attacks:

    - Hijacking the user’s computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software, such as CVE-2014-3524.
    - Hijacking the user’s computer by exploiting the user’s tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from their own website.
    - Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets.
