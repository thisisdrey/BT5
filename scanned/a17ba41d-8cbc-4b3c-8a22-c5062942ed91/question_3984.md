# Q3984: Smart account deployment and initialization: nonce race / foreign context configure / ownership binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with deployment timing around the deployer-specific nonce and predicted address observation while the factory is deploying a brand-new Safe through the standard proxy path and make an attacker use the factory's configuration logic to alter a Safe or Safe-like context it should not own, breaking the rule that deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold and leading to Bypass of intended Safe initialization or module-setup permissions?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: deployment timing around the deployer-specific nonce and predicted address observation
- Exploit idea: make an attacker use the factory's configuration logic to alter a Safe or Safe-like context it should not own
- Invariant to test: deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended Safe initialization or module-setup permissions
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated delegatecall attempts into `configureSmartAccount` and assert the one-shot guard holds in every reachable context.
