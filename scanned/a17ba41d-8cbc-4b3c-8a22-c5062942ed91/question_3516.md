# Q3516: TrustedCalls delegate execution: return-data flow / partial-state batch / no cross-safe bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with trusted targets whose return data may influence later calls in the same transaction while the trusted call eventually reaches Loans, PortfolioVault, or LoansExchange through the Safe and make a batch preserve side effects from earlier calls even though a later call should invalidate the whole operational intent, breaking the rule that a delegate or batch context should never bleed authority across Safe boundaries and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and Safe-module access control?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: trusted targets whose return data may influence later calls in the same transaction
- Exploit idea: make a batch preserve side effects from earlier calls even though a later call should invalidate the whole operational intent
- Invariant to test: a delegate or batch context should never bleed authority across Safe boundaries
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and Safe-module access control
- Fast validation: Model batched calls that share state and assert a revert or invalid later call cannot leave an exploitable partial effect.
