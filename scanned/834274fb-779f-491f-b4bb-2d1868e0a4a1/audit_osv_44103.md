# [H] MCPHub: Missing Authorization on Built-in Prompt & Resource CRUD (Unauthorized Tampering of Globally-Served Templates/Resources)

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-79745
Aliases: GHSA-6cvf-cfch-4g7m
CVSS: 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L)

Type: osv

## Details
MCPHub is a unified hub for centrally managing and dynamically orchestrating multiple MCP servers/APIs into separate endpoints with flexible routing strategies. Prior to version 1.0.32, the built-in prompt and resource controllers perform no role checking. The mutating POST/PUT /api/prompts* and POST/PUT /api/resources* routes are attached to the authenticated router with no admin gate, and the handlers never read req.user. The DAO singletons they write are consulted first — ahead of any connected MCP server — for every session in handleGetPromptRequest / handleReadResourceRequest. A non-admin can therefore create, overwrite, and shadow global prompt templates and resources that all other users are served. The scored impact is the unauthorized integrity violation (creation/tampering/shadowing of globally-served records); stored prompt injection into other users' LLM sessions is a downstream consequence of that tampering. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.32.
