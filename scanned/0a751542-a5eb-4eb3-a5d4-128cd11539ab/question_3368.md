# Q3368: calc-cumulative-debt via collateral-remove-redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it multiplies scaled principal by an index, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption varied, and assert that the value `calc-cumulative-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
