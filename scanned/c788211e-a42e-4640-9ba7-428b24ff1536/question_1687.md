# Q1687: calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction accepts input it should reject (cost_model.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` in `cost-model/src/cost_model.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and have `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `cost-model/src/cost_model.rs` -> `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction()` (around line 203)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
