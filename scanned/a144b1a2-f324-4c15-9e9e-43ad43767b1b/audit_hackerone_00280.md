# Incorrect BDAT data handling leads to DoS 

### Vulnerability Analysis
When receiving data with BDAT command, SMTP server should not consider a single dot `‘.’` in a line to be the end of message. However, we found exim does in receive_msg when parsing header. Like the following output:
```
220 devco.re ESMTP Exim 4.90devstart_213-7c6ec81-XX Mon, 27 Nov 2017 16:58:20 +0800

```
As we mentioned before, exim uses function pointers to switch input source. This bug makes exim go into an incorrect state because the function pointer `receive_getc` is not reset. If the next command is also a BDAT, `receive_getc` and `lwr_receive_getc` become the same and an infinite loop occurs inside `bdat_getc`. Program crashes due to stack exhaustion.
[smtp_in.c: 546 bdat_getc](https://github.com/Exim/exim/blob/e924c08b7d031b712013a7a897e2d430b302fe6c/src/src/smtp_in.c#L546)
```
  if (chunking_data_left > 0)
    return lwr_receive_getc(chunking_data_left--);
```
This is not enough to pose a threat because exim runs a fork server. After a further analysis, we made exim go into an infinite loop without crashing, using the following commands.
```
