## Details
## Summary

The Timesheet API `PATCH /api/timesheets/{id}` and `POST /api/timesheets` endpoints accept a user-supplied `project` ID and resolve it through a Symfony `EntityType` whose `query_builder` allows the submitted ID to satisfy the access predicate via an unconditional OR branch. As a result, any authenticated user can re-assign their own timesheet to any project in the database — including projects that belong to teams or customers they have no membership in and cannot otherwise see. The user can then read serialized project/customer details via `GET /api/timesheets/{id}?full=true`, leaking metadata (name, currency, customer hierarchy) that would otherwise be filtered out by the team ACL.

## Details

### Entry point — only ownership is checked in `src/API/TimesheetController.php:317-355`

```php
#[IsGranted('edit', 'timesheet')]
#[Route(methods: ['PATCH'], path: '/{id}', name: 'patch_timesheet', requirements: ['id' => '\d+'])]
public function patchAction(Request $request, Timesheet $timesheet): Response
{
    ...
    $form = $this->createForm(TimesheetApiEditForm::class, $timesheet, [...]);
    $form->setData($timesheet);
    $form->submit($request->request->all(), false);
    if (false === $form->isValid()) { ... }
    $this->service->saveTimesheet($timesheet);
    ...
}
```

`src/Voter/TimesheetVoter.php:134-142`:

```php
if ($subject->getUser()?->getId() === $user->getId()) {
    return $this->permissionManager->hasRolePermission($user, $permission . '_own_timesheet');
}

if (!$this->permissionManager->checkTeamAccessTimesheet($subject, $user)) {
    return false;
}
```

For an own-timesheet, only `edit_own_timesheet` is required. The voter does **not** look at the *new* project being submitted; it only validates the existing record's ownership.

### Form replays user-controlled project ID into the access query

`src/Form/TimesheetEditForm.php:60-71`:

```php
$isNew = true;
if (isset($options['data']) && $options['data'] instanceof Timesheet) {
    ...
    if (null !== $entry->getId()) {
        $isNew = false;
    }
    ...
}
$this->addProject($builder, $isNew, $project, $customer);
```

`src/Form/FormTrait.php:59-100`:

```php
$builder->addEventListener(
    FormEvents::PRE_SUBMIT,
    function (FormEvent $event) use ($builder, $project, $customer, $isNew, $options): void {
        $data = $event->getData();
        $customer = \array_key_exists('customer', $data) && $data['customer'] !== '' ? $data['customer'] : null;
        $project = \array_key_exists('project', $data) && $data['project'] !== '' ? $data['project'] : $project;

        $event->getForm()->add('project', ProjectType::class, array_merge($options, [
            'group_by' => null,
            'query_builder' => function (ProjectRepository $repo) use ($builder, $project, $customer, $isNew) {
                $project = \is_string($project) ? (int) $project : $project;
                ...
                if ($isNew && \is_int($project)) {
                    $project = $repo->find($project);
                    if ($project !== null) {
                        if (!$project->getCustomer()->isVisible()) { ... $project = null; }
                        elseif (!$project->isVisible())            { $project = null; }
                    }
                }
                ...
                $query = new ProjectFormTypeQuery($project, $customer);
                $query->setUser($builder->getOption('user'));
                $query->setWithCustomer(true);
                return $repo->getQueryBuilderForFormType($query);
            },
        ]));
    }
);
```

Two problems compound:

1. The visibility re-check on line 73 is gated on `$isNew`. For PATCH, `$isNew = false`, so the closure passes the attacker-supplied ID straight through.
2. Even when `$isNew = true` (POST), the re-check only validates `isVisible()` — it does not validate team membership.

### The query-builder unconditionally accepts the submitted ID

`src/Repository/ProjectRepository.php:150-208`:

```php
public function getQueryBuilderForFormType(ProjectFormTypeQuery $query): QueryBuilder
{
    ...
    $mainQuery = $qb->expr()->andX();
    $mainQuery->add($qb->expr()->eq('p.visible', ':visible'));
    $mainQuery->add($qb->expr()->eq('c.visible', ':customer_visible'));
    if (!$query->isIgnoreDate()) { ... }
    if ($query->hasCustomers()) { ... }

    $permissions = $this->getPermissionCriteria($qb, $query->getUser(), $query->getTeams());
    if ($permissions->count() > 0) {
        $mainQuery->add($permissions);
    }

    $outerQuery = $qb->expr()->orX();
    if ($query->hasProjects()) {
        $outerQuery->add($qb->expr()->in('p.id', ':project'));     // <-- unconditional
        $qb->setParameter('project', $query->getProjects());
    }
    ...
    $outerQuery->add($mainQuery);
    $qb->andWhere($outerQuery);
    return $qb;
}
```

The final WHERE clause is roughly:

```
WHERE (p.id IN (:project)) OR (p.visible AND c.visible AND <date> AND <team-ACL>)
```

Because `:project` is the submitted ID itself, the first branch matches unconditionally, completely bypassing the team-ACL applied by `getPermissionCriteria`. Symfony's `EntityType` happily resolves the foreign `Project` entity, the form passes validation, and the timesheet is persisted with the new `project_id`.

### No downstream validation closes the gap

- `TimesheetService::saveTimesheet` → `updateTimesheet` (`src/Timesheet/TimesheetService.php:154-177`) is explicitly documented as *not* validating.
- `TimesheetBasicValidator` only validates begin/end and project/activity coherence.
- `TimesheetDeactivatedValidator::validateActivityAndProject` (`src/Validator/Constraints/TimesheetDeactivatedValidator.php:36-42`) returns early for non-running existing timesheets.
- No validator anywhere in the timesheet pipeline checks that the project's team membership intersects the acting user's teams.

*A PoC was provided, but removed for security reasons.*

## Impact

- **Integrity:** any authenticated user can attribute their own tracked time to any project ID in the database — including projects belonging to teams/customers they cannot see. This pollutes per-project budgets, billing exports and reports for other teams. There is no in-app warning that records belonging to outsiders have been added.
- **Confidentiality:** by reading the timesheet back via `?full=true`, the attacker obtains serialized project and customer details (name, currency, start/end dates, customer hierarchy) which would normally be filtered by the team ACL.
- **Privilege model:** the `edit_own_timesheet` permission is part of the default ROLE_USER, so the bypass is reachable by every regular user without any administrator action.

The blast radius is bounded by what an attacker can persist (their own timesheet rows) and what the `?full=true` serializer exposes — there is no direct ability to modify other teams' existing data.

## Solution

- The FormTrait was updated to only pass the project forward for new timesheets
- A new `TimesheetTeamAccessValidator`was added, which checks if `project` or `activity` were changed. If that is the case, the team access permission is checked first
