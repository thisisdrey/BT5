# Q3103: Address-book role bit isolation: mutual whitelist / stale auth residue / precise unregister

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits while a later `createOffer` or `acceptOffer` flow will read the investor bit from both sides' books and make register/unregister churn leave a grantee usable in later flows after its intended role was supposedly removed, breaking the rule that unregistering one role should not leave or remove unrelated role authority unexpectedly and leading to Unauthorized loan creation or exchange settlement path through role confusion?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits
- Exploit idea: make register/unregister churn leave a grantee usable in later flows after its intended role was supposedly removed
- Invariant to test: unregistering one role should not leave or remove unrelated role authority unexpectedly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized loan creation or exchange settlement path through role confusion
- Fast validation: Fuzz register/unregister churn across roles and ensure no stale authorization survives in create or exchange flows.
