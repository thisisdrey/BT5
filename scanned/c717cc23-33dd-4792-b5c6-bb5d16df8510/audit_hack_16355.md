## Details
# Vulnerability with the collateral transfers happening outside of the market.update() call in the _update() function
## Summary
The collateral transfers happen outside the market.update() call. This leaves room for issues if the market.update() reverts. It could lead to collateral getting stuck. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The key issue is that collateral is transferred to this contract before calling market.update(). If market.update() were to revert for any reason, the collateral would get stuck in this contract.
A malicious actor could exploit this by:
1. Calling _update() with a large collateral deposit
2. Crafting the newMaker/newLong/newShort values to cause market.update() to revert
3. Collateral would get stuck in the contract and the user would lose their funds

## Impact
Collateral would get stuck in the contract and the user would lose their funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Move the collateral transfers inside the market.update() call. This ensures the collateral transfers happen atomically with the market update, preventing the stuck funds vulnerability
