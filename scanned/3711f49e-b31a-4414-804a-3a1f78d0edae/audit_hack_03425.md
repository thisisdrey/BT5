# [M] withdrawToken() May not be able to retrieve NFT

## Summary
Severity: Medium

Type: audit-issue

## Details
# withdrawToken() May not be able to retrieve NFT

## Summary
#withdrawToken() is still received with the old recipient, potentially causing non-malicious users to still fail to accept

## Vulnerability Detail

After #settleContract(), if bull  can not receive NFT will be put NFT to address(this) and write withdrawableCollectionTokenId[NFT] = bull
There are two cases:
1. may be malicious users deliberately do not accept, malicious let the order expiry,  it is a security precaution.
2. may be normal users, but did not implement onERC721Received

If it is the second case, the implementation of #withdrawToken () will still not be able to take out, may lead to NFT being locked.
So it is recommended to add if msg.sender is the recipient, you can specify another receiving address to avoid NFT be locked

```solidity
    function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public {
        address collection = matchedOrders[uint(orderHash)].collection;

        address recipient = withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId];

        // Transfer NFT to recipient
        IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId); //***@audit send to old recipient,may still fail ***//

.....
```

## Impact

 may lead to NFT being locked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
if msg.sender is the recipient, you can specify another receiving address 

```solidity
-    function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId) public {
+    function withdrawToken(bytes32 orderHash, uint tokenId, address to) public {
        address collection = matchedOrders[uint(orderHash)].collection;

        address recipient = withdrawableCollectionTokenId[collection][tokenId];

+       if (msg.sender == recipient && to != address(0) && recipient!=to){
+                 recipient = to;
+        }

        // Transfer NFT to recipient
        IERC721(collection).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, tokenId);

```
