# Q1599: new_warmup_cooldown_rate_epoch charges far less than it costs (lib.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `new_warmup_cooldown_rate_epoch` in `feature-set/src/lib.rs` with a value that makes the limit computation itself overflow into a larger allowance, and make the real CPU/memory cost of `new_warmup_cooldown_rate_epoch` exceed the units charged for it, so that the invariant "Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `feature-set/src/lib.rs` -> `new_warmup_cooldown_rate_epoch()` (around line 284)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a value that makes the limit computation itself overflow into a larger allowance
- Exploit idea: Find the input shape where `new_warmup_cooldown_rate_epoch`'s real CPU/memory/IO cost grows much faster than the compute units or fee charged for it.
- Invariant to test: Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Measure real time/allocations versus units charged across input sizes; assert cost/CU ratio stays bounded.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply force sigverify, dedup, scheduling, or buffering work that vastly exceeds the fees ever collected, degrading the leader below true cost.
