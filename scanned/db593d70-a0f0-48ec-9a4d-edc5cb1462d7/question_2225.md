# Q2225: prefetcher racing the main trie read — storage.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys, an access pattern that keeps the prefetcher and the executing thread on the same nodes, with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes, reach `get_blocks_to_head` in `core/store/src/flat/storage.rs` and have prefetched data enter the witness or the read result non-deterministically, breaking the invariant that prefetching never affects execution results or recorded witness content, leading to Critical - Chunk cannot be validated statelessly (state-witness divergence), permanently stalling or forking the shard?

## Target
- File/function: `core/store/src/flat/storage.rs` :: `get_blocks_to_head`
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys
- Attacker controls: an access pattern that keeps the prefetcher and the executing thread on the same nodes; with keys producing maximal-length extension nodes
- Exploit idea: have prefetched data enter the witness or the read result non-deterministically
- Invariant to test: prefetching never affects execution results or recorded witness content
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Chunk cannot be validated statelessly (state-witness divergence), permanently stalling or forking the shard
- Fast validation: differential test running with prefetching enabled and disabled
