# Q2759: create_pure can write state that another public path misreads

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `create_pure` to create or mutate storage that a different public entrypoint later interprets more permissively than intended?

## Target
- File/function: substrate/frame/proxy/src/lib.rs::create_pure
- Entrypoint: public dispatch wrapper `create_pure`
- Attacker controls: IDs, hashes, nonces, or location fields, batched or wrapped execution context
- Exploit idea: Look for state shared across multiple public entrypoints but validated differently by each one.
- Invariant to test: Shared storage must have one consistent meaning across every public path that consumes it.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized account or call control leading to fund theft or governance capture
- Fast validation: After exercising the entrypoint, call every other public function that touches the same object family and check for inconsistent interpretation.
