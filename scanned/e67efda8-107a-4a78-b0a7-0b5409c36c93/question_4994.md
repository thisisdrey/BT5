# Q4994: calc-utilization via accrue: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `accrue` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block varied, and assert that the value `calc-utilization` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
