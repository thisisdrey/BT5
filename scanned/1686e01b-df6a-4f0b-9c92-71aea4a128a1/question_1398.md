# Q1398: Loan NFT lock and nonce state: rapid epochs / epoch residue / epoch cleanliness

## Question
Can an unprivileged current owner, approved address, buyer, or seller using ordinary NFT actions enter through `LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom` with rapid lock, unlock, and transfer cycles across attacker-controlled addresses while another contract or process will read ownerAndUnlocker or ownershipNonce immediately after the action and make a lock or approval residue survive into the next ownership epoch, breaking the rule that lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward and leading to Unintended or unfair reassignment of loan cashflow rights?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansNFT.sol / lock, unlock, _update
- Entrypoint: LoansNFT.lock(address,uint256), unlock(uint256), transferFrom/safeTransferFrom
- Attacker controls: rapid lock, unlock, and transfer cycles across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: make a lock or approval residue survive into the next ownership epoch
- Invariant to test: lock and approval state should belong to one ownership epoch only and never bleed forward
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair reassignment of loan cashflow rights
- Fast validation: Forge test per-token approvals, lock/unlock cycles, and transfers, then assert nonce, owner, and unlocker views stay in one epoch.
