# Q1254: is_signer_authorized: account-state transition skips a mandatory precondition [a-transfer-path-using-pda] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `transfer_to_new_account` with a transfer path using PDA-owned or delegated account variants so `is_signer_authorized` performs a state transition without validating a required precondition, breaking `only the canonical account authority or validly derived delegate path may mutate account ownership or migration state` and causing `Critical: unauthorized takeover of another user account or funds`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `is_signer_authorized`
- Entrypoint: `transfer_to_new_account`
- Attacker controls: a transfer path using PDA-owned or delegated account variants
- Exploit idea: Focus on initialize/close/freeze/sync transitions where one branch may skip a check that sibling branches enforce. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: only the canonical account authority or validly derived delegate path may mutate account ownership or migration state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: unauthorized takeover of another user account or funds
- Fast validation: Hit the suspect branch directly in a test and assert it rejects the same invalid pre-state that other equivalent branches reject. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
