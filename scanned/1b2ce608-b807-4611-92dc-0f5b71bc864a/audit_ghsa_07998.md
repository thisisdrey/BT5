# [M] cert-manager-controller DoS via Specially Crafted DNS Response

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-gx3x-vq4p-mhhv
CVE: CVE-2026-25518
CWE: CWE-129, CWE-704
Ecosystem: Go
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-02-02
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gx3x-vq4p-mhhv
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager` — affected >=1.18.0 <1.18.5
- Go: `github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager` — affected >=1.19.0 <1.19.3

## Details
### Impact

The cert-manager-controller performs DNS lookups during ACME DNS-01 processing (for zone discovery and propagation self-checks). By default, these lookups use standard unencrypted DNS.

An attacker who can intercept and modify DNS traffic from the cert-manager-controller pod can insert a crafted entry into cert-manager's DNS cache. Accessing this entry will trigger a panic, resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) of the cert-manager controller.

The issue can also be exploited if the authoritative DNS server for the domain being validated is controlled by a malicious actor.

### Patches

The vulnerability was introduced in cert-manager v1.18.0 and has been patched in cert-manager v1.19.3 and v1.18.5, which are the supported minor releases at the time of publishing.

cert-manager versions prior to v1.18.0 are unaffected.

### Workarounds

- Using DNS-over-HTTPS reduces the risk of DNS traffic being intercepted and modified.
    - Note that DNS-over-HTTPS does *not* prevent the risk of an attacker-controlled authoritative DNS server.
