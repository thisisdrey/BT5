# Q3223: TrustedCalls delegate execution: safe parameter / payload extension / atomic batch intent

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with the `safe` parameter, target, and calldata bytes for a supposed trusted call while the batch mixes several individually trusted calls with shared state implications and use trusted selector matching to smuggle attacker-chosen semantics past the intended whitelist boundary, breaking the rule that batched trusted calls should not leave a partially successful operational state that another unprivileged user can exploit and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and Safe-module access control?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: the `safe` parameter, target, and calldata bytes for a supposed trusted call
- Exploit idea: use trusted selector matching to smuggle attacker-chosen semantics past the intended whitelist boundary
- Invariant to test: batched trusted calls should not leave a partially successful operational state that another unprivileged user can exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and Safe-module access control
- Fast validation: Model batched calls that share state and assert a revert or invalid later call cannot leave an exploitable partial effect.
