# Q2516: Vault async redeem flow: share batching / ratio drift / no stranded redeem

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with share amounts chosen to maximize rounding boundaries across several approvals while the manager approves only part of the pending shares before later approvals and make claimableRedeemShares and claimableRedeemAssets decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable redemption value and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: share amounts chosen to maximize rounding boundaries across several approvals
- Exploit idea: make claimableRedeemShares and claimableRedeemAssets decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: no sequence of partial approvals and partial claims should leave a live controller with permanently unclaimable redemption value
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution through excess asset withdrawals
- Fast validation: Fuzz operator churn around redeem claims and ensure only the current authorized controller path can consume reserved assets.
