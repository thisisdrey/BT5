# Q4003: receive-tokens via transfer: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) pulls an asset from a named account. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing `amount`, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `transfer` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `transfer` with `amount`, then read `receive-tokens` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
