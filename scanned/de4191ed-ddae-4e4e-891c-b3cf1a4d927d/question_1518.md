# Q1518: nested DelegateAction rejection — cost.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `DelegateAction` (NEP-366 meta-transaction) handed to any public relayer, a DelegateAction whose action list itself contains another DelegateAction, wrapped several levels deep, with the boundary value chosen exactly at the enforced limit, reach `gas_key_add_key_exec_fee` in `core/parameters/src/cost.rs` and get recursive delegation accepted so authorisation is evaluated against the wrong signer at some depth, breaking the invariant that DelegateAction is never nested inside another DelegateAction, leading to High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `core/parameters/src/cost.rs` :: `gas_key_add_key_exec_fee`
- Entrypoint: a `DelegateAction` (NEP-366 meta-transaction) handed to any public relayer
- Attacker controls: a DelegateAction whose action list itself contains another DelegateAction, wrapped several levels deep; with the boundary value chosen exactly at the enforced limit
- Exploit idea: get recursive delegation accepted so authorisation is evaluated against the wrong signer at some depth
- Invariant to test: DelegateAction is never nested inside another DelegateAction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass
- Fast validation: unit test on validate_delegate_action asserting DelegateActionCantContainNestedOne at every depth
