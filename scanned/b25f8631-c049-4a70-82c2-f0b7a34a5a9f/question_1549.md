# Q1549: calc-utilization via redeem: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, drive `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) — which divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets — to reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated, breaking the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `redeem` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `redeem` with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, then read `calc-utilization` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
