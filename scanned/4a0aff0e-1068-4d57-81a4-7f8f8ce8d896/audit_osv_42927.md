# [H] mtd: slram: remove failed entries from the device list

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-72171
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2026-08-15
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-72171
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=2.6.12 <5.10.261, >=5.11.0 <5.15.212, >=5.16.0 <6.1.178, >=6.2.0 <6.6.145, >=6.7.0 <6.12.97, >=6.13.0 <6.18.40, >=6.19.0 <7.1.5

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: slram: remove failed entries from the device list

register_device() links a new slram_mtdlist entry before allocating all
of the state needed by the entry. If a later allocation, memremap(), or
mtd_device_register() fails, the partially initialized entry remains on
the global list. A later cleanup can then dereference or free invalid
state from that failed entry.

Unwind the partially initialized entry and clear the list tail on each
failure path after the entry has been linked.
