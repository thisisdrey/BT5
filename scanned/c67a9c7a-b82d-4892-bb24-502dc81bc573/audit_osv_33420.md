## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbcon: Set fb_display[i]->mode to NULL when the mode is released

Recently, we discovered the following issue through syzkaller:

BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in fb_mode_is_equal+0x285/0x2f0

Based on experimentation and analysis, during framebuffer unregistration,
only the memory of fb_info->modelist is freed, without setting the
corresponding fb_display[i]->mode to NULL for the freed modes. This leads
to UAF issues during subsequent accesses. Here's an example of reproduction
steps:
1. With /dev/fb0 already registered in the system, load a kernel module
   to register a new device /dev/fb1;
2. Set fb1's mode to the global fb_display[] array (via FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP);
3. Switch console from fb to VGA (to allow normal rmmod of the ko);
4. Unload the kernel module, at this point fb1's modelist is freed, leaving
   a wild pointer in fb_display[];
5. Trigger the bug via system calls through fb0 attempting to delete a mode
   from fb0.

Add a check in do_unregister_framebuffer(): if the mode to be freed exists
in fb_display[], set the corresponding mode pointer to NULL.
