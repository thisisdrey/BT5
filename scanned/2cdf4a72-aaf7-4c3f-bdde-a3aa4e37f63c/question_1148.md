# Q1148: next-liquidity-index via accrue: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update reach `next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `accrue` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update varied, and assert that the value `next-liquidity-index` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
