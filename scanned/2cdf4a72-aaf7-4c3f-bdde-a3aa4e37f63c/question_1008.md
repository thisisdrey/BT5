# Q1008: filter-out-debt-asset via collateral-add: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `filter-out-debt-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
