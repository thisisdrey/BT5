# [M] webpack-dev-server vulnerable to cross-site request forgery via internal developer endpoints

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-f5vj-f2hx-8m93
CVE: CVE-2026-14620
CWE: CWE-352, CWE-749
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-07-20
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f5vj-f2hx-8m93
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- npm: `webpack-dev-server` — affected >=0 <5.2.6

## Details
### Impact

The internal `/webpack-dev-server/open-editor` and `/webpack-dev-server/invalidate` endpoints perform state-changing actions on any `GET` request, without verifying that the request originated from the dev server's own page. Any website a developer visits while the dev server is running can trigger them cross-origin with no interaction beyond the visit.

An attacker can open an arbitrary existing local file in the developer's editor, including files outside the project root (e.g. `~/.ssh/config`). The file's contents are not returned to the attacker. Repeated requests can also spawn editor processes and force recompilations, degrading the developer's machine.

### Patches

Fixed in `webpack-dev-server` 5.2.6 by rejecting cross-site requests to the `/webpack-dev-server/open-editor` and `/webpack-dev-server/invalidate` endpoints (see [PR #5698](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/pull/5698)).

### Workarounds

None
