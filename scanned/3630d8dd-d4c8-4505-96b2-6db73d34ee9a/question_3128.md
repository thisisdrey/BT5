# Q3128: Address-book role bit isolation: mutual whitelist / book bleed / exact whitelist

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits while the canonical `address(this)` book and a self-managed book both contain related addresses and make self-book updates affect canonical-book semantics or another address owner's semantics, breaking the rule that loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution after a wrong-role counterparty enters the lifecycle?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: seller/buyer or originator/counterparty relationships that depend on exact role bits
- Exploit idea: make self-book updates affect canonical-book semantics or another address owner's semantics
- Invariant to test: loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution after a wrong-role counterparty enters the lifecycle
- Fast validation: Forge test role-bit combinations and assert each downstream check accepts only the exact role and exact book intended.
