# Q2822: remove-user-collateral via liquidate-multi: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, can an unprivileged attacker make `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, so the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with the trait principals supplied per entry varied, and assert that the value `remove-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
