# Q1020: can_be_closed: account migration duplicates or strands value [an-account-that-just-ended] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `close_account` with an account that just ended a flashloan or receivership phase so `can_be_closed` duplicates, drops, or strands balances during account migration or transfer, violating `closeability must require the full absence of live economic exposure, blocking flags, and value-bearing side state` and causing `High: permanent loss, stranding, or unauthorized release of live exposure`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `can_be_closed`
- Entrypoint: `close_account`
- Attacker controls: an account that just ended a flashloan or receivership phase
- Exploit idea: Probe migration edges where balances, fees, or authorities are copied then cleared, especially if one half can be replayed or partially completed. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: closeability must require the full absence of live economic exposure, blocking flags, and value-bearing side state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent loss, stranding, or unauthorized release of live exposure
- Fast validation: Simulate partial completion and replay attempts, then assert total exposure across old and new accounts stays conserved. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
