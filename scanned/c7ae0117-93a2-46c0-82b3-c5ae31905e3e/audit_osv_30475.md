# [M] io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2024-53052
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 4.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2024-11-19
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2024-53052
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=5.1.0 <5.10.230, >=5.11.0 <5.15.172, >=5.16.0 <6.1.116, >=6.2.0 <6.6.60, >=6.7.0 <6.11.7

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write

When io_uring starts a write, it'll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the
super block rwsem, preventing any freezes from happening while that
write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing,
excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes
to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which
will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point.
This causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to
complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is
supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write.
This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with
the write blocked starting a new write:

with the attempting freezer stuck trying to grab the rwsem:

 el0t_64_sync+0x168/0x170

Fix this by having the io_uring side honor IOCB_NOWAIT, and only attempt a
blocking grab of the super block rwsem if it isn't set. For normal issue
where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will
have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in
turn also get completions run, ensuring forward progress.

Since freezing requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the first place, this isn't
something that can be triggered by a regular user.
