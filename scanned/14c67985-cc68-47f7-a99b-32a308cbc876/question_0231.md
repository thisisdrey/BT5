# Q0231: Loans create authorization: contract receiver / impersonation / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with an attacker-controlled contract as the proposed investor plus separate EOAs for the other roles while the target counterparty addresses are registered and unregistered across attacker-controlled books in nearby transactions and make `msg.sender` and the effective originator identity diverge so the attacker originates on behalf of another address, breaking the rule that borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and role-based access control?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: an attacker-controlled contract as the proposed investor plus separate EOAs for the other roles
- Exploit idea: make `msg.sender` and the effective originator identity diverge so the attacker originates on behalf of another address
- Invariant to test: borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and role-based access control
- Fast validation: Forge test a caller with only self-book registrations and assert `create` cannot succeed unless the canonical originator book explicitly approves the caller.
