# Q3569: find-collateral-amount via borrow: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, drive `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) — which returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding — to make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist, breaking the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `borrow` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
