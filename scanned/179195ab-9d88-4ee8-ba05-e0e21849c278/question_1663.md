# Q1663: recorded storage counter limit enforcement — mod.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys, a contract that reads deep, wide trie paths until it approaches the per-chunk witness limit, with the input length at exactly the host function's accepted maximum, reach the primary handler in this file in `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/logic/mod.rs` and exceed the recorded-storage limit so the produced chunk cannot be validated statelessly, breaking the invariant that recorded storage is counted and capped before the limit is exceeded, leading to Critical - Chunk cannot be validated statelessly (state-witness divergence), permanently stalling or forking the shard?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/near-vm-runner/src/logic/mod.rs` :: primary handler
- Entrypoint: attacker WASM driving `storage_write` / `storage_remove` / `storage_read` over attacker-chosen keys
- Attacker controls: a contract that reads deep, wide trie paths until it approaches the per-chunk witness limit; with the input length at exactly the host function's accepted maximum
- Exploit idea: exceed the recorded-storage limit so the produced chunk cannot be validated statelessly
- Invariant to test: recorded storage is counted and capped before the limit is exceeded
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Chunk cannot be validated statelessly (state-witness divergence), permanently stalling or forking the shard
- Fast validation: runtime test asserting the receipt fails before the witness cap is passed
