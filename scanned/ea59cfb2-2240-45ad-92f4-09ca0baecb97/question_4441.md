# Q4441: resolve-interpolation-points via repay: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), drive `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) — which selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization — to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, breaking the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `repay` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), then read `resolve-interpolation-points` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
