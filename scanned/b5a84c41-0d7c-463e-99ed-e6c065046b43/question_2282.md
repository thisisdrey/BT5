# Q2282: Vault async redeem flow: split owner-controller / free asset edge / global reserve sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses while the controller already has a prior claimable redeem or pending deposit position and make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side, breaking the rule that totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers and leading to User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side
- Invariant to test: totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Exhaust a controller's claimable redemption in alternating share and asset units and assert no dust or reserve mismatch remains.
