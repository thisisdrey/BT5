# Q1711: Exchange offer lifecycle: accept timing / bundle inconsistency / full unlock on cancel

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer-controlled acceptance timing near expiry or around other state changes while the offer contains multiple loans whose economic state can diverge while storage stays static and make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert, breaking the rule that cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue and leading to Loans NFT being stuck or left under a stale exchange lock?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer-controlled acceptance timing near expiry or around other state changes
- Exploit idea: make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert
- Invariant to test: cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT being stuck or left under a stale exchange lock
- Fast validation: Forge test directed offers with multiple loans, expiry edges, and registration churn, then assert full delivery or full revert.
