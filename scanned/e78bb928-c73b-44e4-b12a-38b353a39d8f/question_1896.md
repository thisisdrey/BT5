# Q1896: accrue-collateral-asset via accrue: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block reach `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `accrue` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `accrue-collateral-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
