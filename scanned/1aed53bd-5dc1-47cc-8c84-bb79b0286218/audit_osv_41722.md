# [M] Hurl: Cookies in Cookies section leak when redirecting to a different host

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-63481
Aliases: GHSA-7w2g-9mf9-324m
CVSS: 6.0 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)
Published: 2026-08-20

Type: osv

## Details
Hurl is a command line tool that runs and tests HTTP requests defined in plain text files. In version 8.0.1 and earlier, the redirect handling in packages/hurl/src/http/client.rs strips Authorization and Cookie headers and basic-auth credentials when a redirect changes host, but it carries RequestSpec.cookies created from the dedicated [Cookies] section into the redirected request. An attacker-controlled redirect can therefore receive authentication or session cookies that should remain scoped to the original host. Cookies supplied through a raw Cookie header are stripped and are not affected by this specific path. This issue is reported as fixed in version 8.1.0.
