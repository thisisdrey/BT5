# [H] CL-2026-08: get_expected_withdrawals allows multiple withdrawals exceeding validator balance

## Summary
Severity: High
Chain: Ethereum (consensus layer)
Component: Consensus Specifications
Source: https://notes.ethereum.org/Ad3MXVBDSPWbrqkkKi3s1Q
Type: ef-disclosure

## Details
The `get_expected_withdrawals` function from the Ethereum consensus spec does not account for cases where multiple withdrawals are pending for the same validator.
Attack scenario *
More detailed description of the attack/bug scenario and unexpected/buggy behaviour
Consider the following scenario:
1. Validator A (with compounding credentials) is active and has a balance and effective balance of 2,048 ETH.
2. Validator A initiates two withdrawals, each for 1,008 ETH. Since `2048 - 1008 - 1008 = 32`, both requests pass verification in `process_withdrawal_request` and are added to the pending withdrawals queue.
3. Assume the pending withdrawals queue is sufficiently full, delaying execution of both requests.
4. The chain stops finalizing, and validator A becomes offline. This is serious precondition but I believe it is still a legit edge case.
5. Validator A begins leaking ETH due to inactivity, and over time, its balance decreases to 2,015 ETH (which takes about 3 days if I understand everything correctly).
6. Now suppose both withdrawals are processed within the same block.
7. According to the current implementation of `get_expected_withdrawals`, both withdrawals will be included as-is, since each withdrawal amount (1008) is less than 2015 - 32. However, the function does not consider cumulative effects of multiple withdrawals from the same validator. This leads to a situation where more ETH is withdrawn than the validator's actual balance.
8. Now, this is already a problem since we essentially allow to withdraw more than current validator balance. The issue becomes more severe if the validator is also swept in the same block. The following logic is then executed:
```
partially_withdrawn_balance = sum(
   withdrawal.amount for withdrawal in withdrawals if withdrawal.validator_index == validator_index)
balance = state.balances[validator_index] - partially_withdrawn_balance
```
9. Since `partially_withdrawn_balance > balance`, this causes an underflow. Different clients handle this differently:
* Prysm silently wraps around: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/blob/bab898d1d38bb146f2c4770fc9032f683e69fd22/beacon-chain/state/state-native/getters_withdrawal.go#L168
* Lighthouse stops block processing and returns an error: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/af51d50b05b75f078f710c719b62beee397274d4/consensus/state_processing/src/per_block_processing.rs#L579-L585
* Teku clamps the balance to zero: https://github.com/Consensys/teku/blob/fff23857fc36508d6ae0d08ba51e48529ce28584/ethereum/spec/src/main/java/tech/pegasys/teku/spec/datastructures/execution/ExpectedWithdrawals.java#L238-L239
* I haven't investigated other clients, as a disagreement between these three major clients is already sufficient to cause a dramatic consensus split.

While the scenario requires specific conditions (e.g., long inactivity leak, sufficiently filled pending withdrawal queue, and precise timing), it exposes a valid edge case that can result in drastic consequences.
Impact *
 Describe the effect this may have in a production setting
This issue allows an attacker (or a faulty state) to trigger a chain split between major consensus clients. Though unlikely, the scenario is plausible and exposes a critical inconsistency in client behavior due to the protocol’s failure to enforce a total withdrawal limit per validator.
Components *
Point to the files, functions, and/or specific line numbers where the bug occurs
The root cause lies in the specification of the `get_expected_withdrawals` function, which should ensure that the total amount withdrawn per validator does not exceed the current balance minus `MIN_ACTIVATION_BALANCE`. If the function enforced this invariant, the underflow in downstream logic would be impossible. https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#modified-get_expected_withdrawals
Reproduction *
If used any sort of tools/simulations to find the bug, describe in detail how to reproduce the buggy behaviour.
An end-to-end reproduction is non-trivial due to precise timings and inactivity leakage requirements. However, the following unit test demonstrates that conditions described earlier can lead to a failure due to underflow. The test assumes the described state can be reached:
