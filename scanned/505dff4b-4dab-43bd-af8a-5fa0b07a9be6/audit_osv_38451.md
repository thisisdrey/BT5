# [M] nimiq-blockchain: network-libp2p untrusted peer can crash address book via empty peer contact addresses

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-40094
Aliases: GHSA-c45m-6x25-3cjq
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

Type: osv

## Details
nimiq-blockchain provides persistent block storage for Nimiq's Rust implementation. In versions 1.3.0 and prior, network-libp2p discovery accepts signed PeerContact updates from untrusted peers and stores them in a peer contact book, eventually leading to address book crash. A PeerContact can legally contain an empty addresses list (no intrinsic validation enforces non-empty). Later, PeerContactBook::known_peers builds an address book by taking addresses.first().expect("every peer should have at least one address"). If the attacker has inserted a signed peer contact with addresses=[], any call to get_address_book (RPC/web client) can panic and crash the node/RPC task depending on panic settings. This issue has been fixed in version 1.4.0.
