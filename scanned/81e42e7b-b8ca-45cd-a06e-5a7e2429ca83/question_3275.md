# Q3275: TrustedCalls delegate execution: selector shape / partial-state batch / atomic batch intent

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, with no authority over any victim Safe or privileged protocol role enter through `TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)` with calldata whose first 4 bytes are trusted while the remaining payload is attacker-chosen while the whitelist contains the target/selector pair for a legitimate operational path and make a batch preserve side effects from earlier calls even though a later call should invalidate the whole operational intent, breaking the rule that batched trusted calls should not leave a partially successful operational state that another unprivileged user can exploit and leading to Theft or unauthorized movement of value from another Safe or user context?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedCalls.sol / executeTrustedCall, executeTrustedCallBatch
- Entrypoint: TrustedCalls.executeTrustedCall(...) and executeTrustedCallBatch(...)
- Attacker controls: calldata whose first 4 bytes are trusted while the remaining payload is attacker-chosen
- Exploit idea: make a batch preserve side effects from earlier calls even though a later call should invalidate the whole operational intent
- Invariant to test: batched trusted calls should not leave a partially successful operational state that another unprivileged user can exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized movement of value from another Safe or user context
- Fast validation: Check that a delegate of one Safe cannot drive Loans, Vault, or Exchange state as if acting for another Safe.
