# Q0051: Loans create authorization: self-book spoof / unauthorized create / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged caller with no guardian, admin, originator, or servicer powers enter through `Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)` with only a self-curated address book plus attacker-controlled borrower, investor, and servicer addresses while a victim investor or vault could later interact with the created loan through funding, withdrawal, or pricing flows and make `create` accept a caller that is neither the approved originator nor an admin/guardian, breaking the rule that borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution once the unauthorized loan enters normal funding and withdrawal flows?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / create
- Entrypoint: Loans.create(address,address,address,address,int128,uint48)
- Attacker controls: only a self-curated address book plus attacker-controlled borrower, investor, and servicer addresses
- Exploit idea: make `create` accept a caller that is neither the approved originator nor an admin/guardian
- Invariant to test: borrower, investor, servicer, and originator authorization should come from the intended book and role only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution once the unauthorized loan enters normal funding and withdrawal flows
- Fast validation: Fuzz `msg.sender`, the `originator` parameter, and address-book contents, then assert every successful create binds to a canonically approved originator only.
