# Q0446: Loans funding and disbursement state: fresh owner / epoch confusion / exact commitment

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a loan NFT that the attacker just acquired through a normal transfer or exchange settlement while a vault, buyer, or downstream counterparty could rely on the resulting balances after funding or disbursement and make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions, breaking the rule that the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan and leading to Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a loan NFT that the attacker just acquired through a normal transfer or exchange settlement
- Exploit idea: make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions
- Invariant to test: the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC
- Fast validation: Fuzz commitment-sized amounts and lifecycle orderings, then assert funding and disbursement preserve the exact same commitment ledger.
