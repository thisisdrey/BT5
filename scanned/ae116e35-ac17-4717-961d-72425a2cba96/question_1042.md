# Q1042: Investor withdrawal routing: ownership churn / wrong recipient / single claim per payable

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts while the first loan in the batch is locked and fixes the recipient as the active unlocker and make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans, breaking the rule that each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts
- Exploit idea: make principal or interest route to the wrong recipient for one of the batched loans
- Invariant to test: each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later misprices a vault or secondary sale
- Fast validation: Check that every withdrawable principal and interest balance can be claimed exactly once and never becomes unreachable after a normal epoch change.
