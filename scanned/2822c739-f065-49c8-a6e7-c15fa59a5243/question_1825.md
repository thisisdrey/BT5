# Q1825: Exchange offer lifecycle: address-book churn / stale snapshot / one live offer state

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance while the offer contains multiple loans whose economic state can diverge while storage stays static and make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way, breaking the rule that an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance
- Exploit idea: make acceptance settle against an offer snapshot whose effective economic state has already changed in a user-controlled way
- Invariant to test: an active offer should have exactly one live storage record and one matching lock state for every listed loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution in secondary sale settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
