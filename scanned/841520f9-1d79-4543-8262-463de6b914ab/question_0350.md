# Q0350: Loans funding and disbursement state: standing allowance / epoch confusion / exact commitment

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing while status-like fields or off-chain expectations changed nearby but the economic balances still define the real state and make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions, breaking the rule that the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing
- Exploit idea: make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions
- Invariant to test: the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement
- Fast validation: Model a create-transfer-fund-disburse sequence and assert stale ownership or stale lock state never authorizes a later epoch.
