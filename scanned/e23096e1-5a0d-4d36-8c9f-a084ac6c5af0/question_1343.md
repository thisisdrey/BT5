# Q1343: collect_accounts_for_failed_tx mishandles duplicate/aliased accounts (account_saver.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `collect_accounts_for_failed_tx` in `runtime/src/account_saver.rs` with an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data, and have `collect_accounts_for_failed_tx` read a stale copy of an account passed twice in the same instruction, so that the invariant "Aliased account references observe a single coherent value throughout the instruction." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/account_saver.rs` -> `collect_accounts_for_failed_tx()` (around line 144)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data
- Exploit idea: Pass the same account at two indices so `collect_accounts_for_failed_tx` reads a stale copy and writes back a value computed from it, duplicating or erasing a balance.
- Invariant to test: Aliased account references observe a single coherent value throughout the instruction.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Unit test the path with the same pubkey at two indices; assert the final lamports match the single-reference case.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can get a packet accepted into banking with signature verification, dedup, or sanitization effectively skipped, so an unauthorized or malformed transaction reaches execution.
