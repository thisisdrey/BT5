# Anyone can call the withdrawToken function to send the NFT in the contract that is not in the withdrawableCollectionTokenId to address 0

## Summary
Anyone can call the withdrawToken function to send the NFT in the contract that is not in the withdrawableCollectionTokenId to address 0
## Vulnerability Detail

If there are some NFTs in the contract that are not in the withdrawableCollectionTokenId (like an airdrop), the user can create an order and call the matchOrder function to make the NFT address appear in matchedOrders, and then call the withdrawToken function to send the NFT to address 0.

Anyone can call the withdrawToken function to send the NFT in the contract that is not in the withdrawableCollectionTokenId to address 0
