**Summary:** 

The libuv's implementation of realpath is flawed on darwin and may cause buffer overflow.

**Description:** 

libuv's `realpath` implementation determines the buffer size with `pathconf` and fallback to `_POSIX_PATH_MAX` (256) if that fails for any reason (eg. `ENOENT`). However `realpath` requires a buffer of at least `PATH_MAX` (1024) bytes to be used, hence causes the buffer overflow if the resolved path is longer than 256 bytes.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. `LONG_PATH='/tmp/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/path/254B'`
1. `SHORT_LINK='/tmp/short'`
1. `mkdir -p "${LONG_PATH}"`
1. `ln -s "${LONG_PATH}" "${SHORT_LINK}"`
1. `node -e "fs.realpathSync.native('${SHORT_LINK}/file-not-exist')"`

## Impact: 

Cause node process to crash.

## Impact

Given that nodejs on darwin are mostly desktop applications and used as developer tools, exploit this is very unlikely to cause more damage than an application crash.
