## Summary

Program: curl
Weakness: Improper Authentication - Generic

CVE: CVE-2026-8927, CVE-2026-7168
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/3744543

## Details
## AI-assisted preparation note

I used AI assistance to help structure and format this report, but the technical findings, PoC, and verification results are based on local testing against curl/libcurl 8.20.0.

## Summary

I found a possible incomplete-fix variant of CVE-2026-7168 in libcurl 8.20.0.

The original issue involved stale Digest proxy authentication state being sent from `proxyA` to `proxyB` when the same libcurl easy handle was reused after changing proxies. In curl 8.20.0, the explicit `CURLOPT_PROXY` path appears to be fixed: changing the proxy via `CURLOPT_PROXY` clears the old proxy Digest/auth state correctly.

However, I found that the same cleanup does not appear to happen when the effective proxy changes through environment variables such as `http_proxy` or `ALL_PROXY`.

As a result, when the same easy handle is reused:

1. The first transfer uses `proxyA` from `http_proxy` and authenticates with HTTP Digest proxy authentication.
2. The environment variable is changed so the next transfer uses `proxyB`.
3. The same easy handle performs the second transfer.
4. `proxyB` receives a `Proxy-Authorization: Digest` header using stale Digest state from `proxyA`.

This was reproduced against official curl/libcurl 8.20.0.

## Affected version

Tested against official curl/libcurl 8.20.0.

The PoC confirms:

```text
LIBCURL_RUNTIME=8.20.0
LIBCURL_HEADERS=8.20.0
```

## Impact

A malicious second proxy can receive a `Proxy-Authorization: Digest` header generated from the previous proxy's Digest challenge state.

In my replay test, the header captured by `proxyB` was valid for `proxyA` and could be replayed successfully. This is the same security class as CVE-2026-7168: proxy authentication state intended for one proxy crosses a proxy boundary and is exposed to another proxy.

This can allow a malicious proxy to capture and replay Digest proxy authentication material intended for another proxy.

## Technical details

The explicit proxy-change path appears to be fixed in 8.20.0.

When an application changes the proxy using `CURLOPT_PROXY`, the previous proxy Digest/auth state is cleared. My control test confirmed:

```text
CURLOPT_PROXY proxyA -> CURLOPT_PROXY proxyB
Result: no stale Proxy-Authorization header sent to proxyB
```

The environment-derived proxy path behaves differently.

When the proxy is selected from `http_proxy` or `ALL_PROXY`, changing the environment variable from `proxyA` to `proxyB` causes the second transfer to use `proxyB`, but the previous Digest proxy-auth state remains associated with the reused easy handle.

Observed request received by `proxyB`:

```http
GET http://example.test/protected HTTP/1.1
Host: example.test
Proxy-Authorization: Digest username="silly", realm="realmA", nonce="nonceA", uri="/protected", ...
```

`realmA` and `nonceA` were issued by `proxyA`, not `proxyB`.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Build curl/libcurl 8.20.0.
2. Run the PoC below.
3. The PoC starts two local HTTP proxy servers:
   - `proxyA` issues a Digest proxy-auth challenge.
   - `proxyB` captures the first request it receives.
4. The client uses one reused libcurl easy handle.
5. First transfer:
   - `http_proxy=http://silly:person@127.0.0.1:<proxyA>`
   - libcurl authenticates to `proxyA` using Digest.
6. Second transfer:
   - `http_proxy=http://silly:person@127.0.0.1:<proxyB>`
   - same easy handle reused.
7. `proxyB` receives a stale `Proxy-Authorization: Digest` header using `proxyA`'s realm/nonce.

## Expected result

When the effective proxy changes from `proxyA` to `proxyB`, libcurl should clear proxy Digest/auth state before the second transfer, regardless of whether the proxy was changed via `CURLOPT_PROXY` or selected from environment variables.

`proxyB` should not receive a `Proxy-Authorization: Digest` header based on `proxyA`'s challenge.

## Actual result

`proxyB` receives:

```http
Proxy-Authorization: Digest username="silly", realm="realmA", nonce="nonceA", ...
```

The captured Digest response was replayed to `proxyA` in my full PoC and accepted.

PoC summary:

```json
{
  "runtime": "8.20.0",
  "headers": "8.20.0",
  "B_received_proxy_authorization": true,
  "B_digest_valid_for_proxyA": true,
  "replay_status": "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
}
```

The request captured by `proxyB` contains:

```http
Proxy-Authorization: Digest username="silly", realm="realmA", nonce="nonceA", ...
```

## Controls tested

The following controls were tested to reduce false positives:

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| Same easy handle + env `http_proxy` proxyA -> proxyB | Vulnerable: stale Digest sent |
| Same easy handle + env `ALL_PROXY` proxyA -> proxyB | Vulnerable: stale Digest sent |
| Explicit `CURLOPT_PROXY` proxyA -> proxyB | Not vulnerable |
| New easy handle for second request | Not vulnerable |
| `curl_easy_reset()` before second request | Not vulnerable |
| `CURLOPT_PROXY = NULL` before second request | Not vulnerable |
| proxyB has no credentials | Not vulnerable in my test |
| proxyB has credentials/user-only credentials | Vulnerable: stale Digest state sent |

## Suggested fix direction

Apply the same proxy-auth cleanup used for explicit `CURLOPT_PROXY` changes when the effective proxy changes due to environment variable resolution.

When the resolved proxy changes between transfers on a reused easy handle, libcurl should clear/reset the previous proxy-auth state before generating a new `Proxy-Authorization` header, including at least:

```text
data->state.proxydigest
data->state.authproxy
```

or the equivalent proxy-auth state.

## Note

This report is not claiming that the explicit `CURLOPT_PROXY` fix is missing. I verified that the explicit `CURLOPT_PROXY` path is fixed in 8.20.0.

The issue is that an equivalent proxy-boundary change through environment variables such as `http_proxy` or `ALL_PROXY` still appears to leave stale Digest proxy-auth state on the reused easy handle.

## Impact

A malicious second proxy can receive a Proxy-Authorization: Digest header generated from a previous proxy’s Digest challenge state. In the PoC, this captured header was valid for the original proxy and could be replayed successfully, allowing authentication material intended for proxyA to cross the proxy boundary and be exposed to proxyB. This may allow capture/replay of proxy authentication and unauthorized use of the victim’s authenticated proxy session.
