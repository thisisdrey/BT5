# [H] ibmvnic: Don't reference skb after sending to VIOS

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2025-21855
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 8.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H)
Published: 2025-03-12
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2025-21855
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=4.5.0 <6.1.130, >=6.2.0 <6.6.80, >=6.7.0 <6.12.17, >=6.13.0 <6.13.5

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Don't reference skb after sending to VIOS

Previously, after successfully flushing the xmit buffer to VIOS,
the tx_bytes stat was incremented by the length of the skb.

It is invalid to access the skb memory after sending the buffer to
the VIOS because, at any point after sending, the VIOS can trigger
an interrupt to free this memory. A race between reading skb->len
and freeing the skb is possible (especially during LPM) and will
result in use-after-free:
