# Q1049: Investor withdrawal routing: ownership churn / batch bleed / per-loan recipient

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts while the first loan in the batch is locked and fixes the recipient as the active unlocker and make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it, breaking the rule that every loan in investorWithdraw should pay only the recipient implied by that same loan's current owner and lock state and leading to Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: NFT ownership changes across attacker-controlled addresses between withdrawal attempts
- Exploit idea: make the authorization or recipient cached from the first loan bleed into another loan that should not share it
- Invariant to test: every loan in investorWithdraw should pay only the recipient implied by that same loan's current owner and lock state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or diversion of other users' loan cashflows
- Fast validation: Fuzz batched loan ordering and payable compositions and assert the first loan's cached recipient never bleeds into another loan improperly.
