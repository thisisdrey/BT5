## Details
nanobot is a personal AI assistant. Versions prior to 0.1.5 contain a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability exists in the bridge's WebSocket server in bridge/src/server.ts, resulting from an incomplete remediation of CVE-2026-2577. The original fix changed the binding from 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 and added an optional BRIDGE_TOKEN parameter, but token authentication is disabled by default and the server does not validate the Origin header during the WebSocket handshake. Because browsers do not enforce the Same-Origin Policy on WebSockets unless the server explicitly denies cross-origin connections, any website visited by a user running the bridge can establish a WebSocket connection to ws://127.0.0.1:3001/ and gain full access to the bridge API. This allows an attacker to hijack the WhatsApp session, read incoming messages, steal authentication QR codes, and send messages on behalf of the user. This issue has bee fixed in version 0.1.5.
