# Q5810: remove-user-collateral via collateral-remove-redeem: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, can an unprivileged attacker make `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, so the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem varied, and assert that the value `remove-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
