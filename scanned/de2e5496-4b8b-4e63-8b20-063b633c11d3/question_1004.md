# Q1004: calc-treasury-lp-preview via deposit: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge reach `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow, the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `deposit` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `deposit` twice with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge varied, and assert that the value `calc-treasury-lp-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
