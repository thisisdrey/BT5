# [H] phar_tar_writeheaders_int() buffer overflow

## Summary
Severity: High (CVSS 8.1)
Program: Internet Bug Bounty
Weakness: Classic Buffer Overflow
Reporter: jordyzomer
State: resolved
Disclosed: 2020-11-09T01:46:01.959Z
CVE: CVE-2019-9675
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/504761

## Details
A buffer overflow has been found in the phar_tar_writeheaders_int() function.

it does a strncpy to header->linkname from entry->link with the size of entry->link.

As you can see in https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/phar/tar.h#L66 , header->linkname is a char of the size 100. Once entry->link contains a value that's bigger than 100 it will overflow the _tar_header structure.

This can be fixed by setting the size argument of strncpy to sizeof(header->linkname) for example:

strncpy(header.linkname, entry->link, strlen(header->linkname);

This has been fixed in the following references:
