# Q4474: calc-index-next via redeem: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `recipient`, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `redeem` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with `recipient`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
