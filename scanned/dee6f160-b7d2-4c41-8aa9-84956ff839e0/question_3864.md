# Q3864: Smart account deployment and initialization: init arrays / address confusion / ownership binding

## Question
Can an unprivileged deployer or external caller with no guardian or admin powers enter through `SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)` with delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer while a second configuration attempt is made against a Safe that already ran initialization once and make predicted-address semantics diverge from the actual deployed account or from who effectively controls it, breaking the rule that deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold and leading to Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/SmartAccountFactory.sol / deploySmartAccount, configureSmartAccount, predictSmartAccountAddress
- Entrypoint: SmartAccountFactory.deploySmartAccount(...) and predictSmartAccountAddress(...)
- Attacker controls: delegates, currencies, NFT collections, trusted recipients, owners, and threshold in the deployment initializer
- Exploit idea: make predicted-address semantics diverge from the actual deployed account or from who effectively controls it
- Invariant to test: deployment should never create a Safe whose effective post-init control diverges from the declared owners and threshold
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized delegate or spending surface on a deployed smart account
- Fast validation: Fuzz initializer arrays and duplicate entries, then assert the resulting Safe has exactly the declared owners, threshold, delegates, and routes.
