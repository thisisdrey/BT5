# Q1662: Exchange offer lifecycle: seller inputs / bundle inconsistency / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline while one side is a vault or later counterparty that relies on precise lock cleanup and delivery semantics and make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: seller-controlled loanIds, buyer, price, and deadline
- Exploit idea: make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
