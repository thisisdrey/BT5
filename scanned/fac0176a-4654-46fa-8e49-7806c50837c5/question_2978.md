# Q2978: Address-book role bit isolation: book churn / bit confusion / book isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with rapid register/unregister cycles for the same grantee across different roles while the same grantee address is intentionally present under multiple roles for legitimate reasons and make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role, breaking the rule that a self-managed address book should never satisfy canonical-book checks or another owner's checks and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: rapid register/unregister cycles for the same grantee across different roles
- Exploit idea: make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role
- Invariant to test: a self-managed address book should never satisfy canonical-book checks or another owner's checks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules
- Fast validation: Forge test role-bit combinations and assert each downstream check accepts only the exact role and exact book intended.
