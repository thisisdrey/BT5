# [M] Sysctls applied to containers with host IPC or host network namespaces can affect the host

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-w2j5-3rcx-vx7x
Ecosystem: Go
Published: 2022-03-15
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w2j5-3rcx-vx7x
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/cri-o/cri-o` — affected >=1.23.0 <1.23.1
- Go: `github.com/cri-o/cri-o` — affected >=1.22.0 <1.22.2
- Go: `github.com/cri-o/cri-o` — affected >=1.21.0 <1.21.5
- Go: `github.com/cri-o/cri-o` — affected >=1.20.0 <1.20.6
- Go: `github.com/cri-o/cri-o` — affected >=1.18.0 <1.19.5

## Details
### Impact
Before setting the sysctls for a pod, the pods namespaces must be unshared (created). However, in cases where the pod is using a host network or IPC namespace, a bug in CRI-O caused the namespace creating tool [pinns](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/tree/main/pinns/) to configure the sysctls of the host. This allows a malicious user to set sysctls on the host, assuming they have access to hostNetwork and hostIPC.

Any CRI-O cluster after CRI-O 1.18 that drops the infra container
1.22 and 1.23 clusters drop infra container by default, and are thus vulnerable by default.

### Patches
CRI-O versions 1.24.0, 1.23.1, 1.22.2, 1.21.5, 1.20.6, 1.19.5 all have the patches.

### Workarounds
Users can set `manage_ns_lifecycle` to false, which causes the sysctls to be configured by the OCI runtime, which typically filter these cases. This option is available in 1.20 and 1.19. Newer versions don't have this option.
An admission webhook could also be created to deny pods that use host IPC or network namespaces and also attempt to configure sysctls related to that namespace.
