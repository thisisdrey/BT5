# [M] CVE-2026-58080

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-58080
CVSS: 6.0 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)
Published: 2026-08-04
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-58080
Type: osv

## Details
In Eclipse Milo versions 1.0.0 through 1.1.4, `OpcUaServerConfig.copy()` fails to preserve a configured `RoleMapper`. On servers that rely on role permissions and construct the running configuration through `copy()`, sessions receive no role IDs and the default access controller skips role-permission checks, allowing an anonymous client where anonymous sessions are permitted to read role-permission metadata, invoke protected methods, or delete protected nodes.
