## Details
# It assumes totalAssets and totalShares cannot be 0. This could happen if the contract is just initialized.
## Summary
In the convertToShares and convertToAssets functions, it is possible for _totalAssets or _totalShares to be 0 if the contract was just initialized.
## Vulnerability Detail
the convertToShares() and convertToAssets() functions could divide by 0 if _totalAssets or _totalShares is 0. Here is the relevant code: [Link1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L130-L134) and [link2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L139-L143)
If _totalAssets or _totalShares is 0, it would cause a division by 0 error and revert the transaction.

This could happen right after deploying the contract, before any assets or shares have been minted. Or if assets and shares have been burned down to 0 for some reason.

An attacker could intentionally manipulate assets and shares to 0 to make the contract unusable.
## Impact
An attacker could intentionally manipulate assets and shares to 0 to make the contract unusable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 The contract should check for 0 values and handle them safely
