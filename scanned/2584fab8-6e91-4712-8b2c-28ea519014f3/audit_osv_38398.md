# [M] osslsigncode has an Out-of-Bounds Read via Unvalidated Section Bounds in PE Page Hash Calculation

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-39856
Aliases: GHSA-rjrx-chvw-8jw8
CVSS: 5.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

Type: osv

## Details
osslsigncode is a tool that implements Authenticode signing and timestamping. Prior to 2.13, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in osslsigncode version 2.12 and earlier in the PE page-hash computation code (pe_page_hash_calc()). When processing PE sections for page hashing, the function uses PointerToRawData and SizeOfRawData values from section headers without validating that the referenced region lies within the mapped file. An attacker can craft a PE file with section headers that point beyond the end of the file. When osslsigncode computes page hashes for such a file, it may attempt to hash data from an invalid memory region, causing an out-of-bounds read and potentially crashing the process. The vulnerability can be triggered while signing a malicious PE file with page hashing enabled (-ph), or while verifying a malicious signed PE file that already contains page hashes. Verification of an already signed file does not require the verifier to pass -ph. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.13.
