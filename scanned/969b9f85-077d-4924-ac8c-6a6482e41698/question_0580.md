# Q0580: chunk validation re-execution divergence — rpc_handler.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `FunctionCall` action into an attacker-deployed contract, a contract whose execution depends on data the witness does not fully determine, when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit, reach `is_chunk_producer_for_transaction_in_epoch` in `chain/client/src/rpc_handler.rs` and make stateless validation of an honestly produced chunk fail or produce a different root, breaking the invariant that re-execution from the witness reproduces the producer's result exactly, leading to Critical - Chunk cannot be validated statelessly (state-witness divergence), permanently stalling or forking the shard?

## Target
- File/function: `chain/client/src/rpc_handler.rs` :: `is_chunk_producer_for_transaction_in_epoch`
- Entrypoint: a `FunctionCall` action into an attacker-deployed contract
- Attacker controls: a contract whose execution depends on data the witness does not fully determine; when transaction conversion cost alone approaches the chunk gas limit
- Exploit idea: make stateless validation of an honestly produced chunk fail or produce a different root
- Invariant to test: re-execution from the witness reproduces the producer's result exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Chunk cannot be validated statelessly (state-witness divergence), permanently stalling or forking the shard
- Fast validation: differential test re-executing the chunk from its witness
