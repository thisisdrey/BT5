## Summary
Severity: Medium
Program: curl
Weakness: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness
Reporter: nyymi

CVE: CVE-2023-27535
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/1892780

## Details
## Summary:
libcurl FTP(S) protocol will reuse connection even if different `CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT` (libcurl) or `--ftp-account` (curl) is specified for different connections and the server requests account authentication via reply code `332`. It appears that `STRING_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER ` (libcurl) or `--ftp-alternative-to-user` (curl) is also affected and should also result in caching being refused.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. terminal 1: `echo -e "foo\n" | nc -v -l -p 9998; echo -e "bar\n" | nc -v -l -p 9998`
  2. terminal 2:  `echo -ne "220 a\n331 b\n332 c\n230 d\n257 \"/\"\n229 (|||9998|)\n200 e\n213 4\n150 f\n226 g\n229 (|||9998|)\n213 4\n150 f\n226 g\n" | nc -v -l -p 9999`
  3. terminal 3: `curl -v --ftp-account alice "ftp://ftp@server:9999/file1" -: --ftp-account bob "ftp://ftp@server:9999/file2"`

As a result connection authenticated as user `alice` will be used when fetching `file2` regardless that user `bob` was specified for fetching it.

## Remediation
* Don't reuse connection if `CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT` or `STRING_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER`  are different.
