# Q2298: Vault async redeem flow: split owner-controller / free asset edge / global reserve sum

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses while idleLiquidity is just above the approved reserve and later user activity could consume nearby balances and make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side, breaking the rule that totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers and leading to Accounting issue in the vault leading to underreserved claimable redemptions?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: make withdraw() or redeem() round one side to zero while still transferring value on the other side
- Invariant to test: totalClaimableRedeemAssets should always equal the sum of claimableRedeemAssets across controllers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in the vault leading to underreserved claimable redemptions
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated redeem()/withdraw() calls against partially approved redemptions and assert reserve counters stay exact.
