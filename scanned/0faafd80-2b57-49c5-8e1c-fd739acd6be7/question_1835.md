# Q1835: get_obsolete_bytes charges far less than it costs (account_storage_entry.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `get_obsolete_bytes` in `accounts-db/src/account_storage_entry.rs` with a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write, and make the real CPU/memory cost of `get_obsolete_bytes` exceed the units charged for it, so that the invariant "Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/account_storage_entry.rs` -> `get_obsolete_bytes()` (around line 149)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write
- Exploit idea: Find the input shape where `get_obsolete_bytes`'s real CPU/memory/IO cost grows much faster than the compute units or fee charged for it.
- Invariant to test: Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Measure real time/allocations versus units charged across input sizes; assert cost/CU ratio stays bounded.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can cheaply force sigverify, dedup, scheduling, or buffering work that vastly exceeds the fees ever collected, degrading the leader below true cost.
