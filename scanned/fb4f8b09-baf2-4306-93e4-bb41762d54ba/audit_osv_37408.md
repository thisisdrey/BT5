# [H] net/smc: fix double-free of smc_spd_priv when tee() duplicates splice pipe buffer

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-31507
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2026-04-22
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2026-31507
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=4.18.0 <5.10.253, >=5.11.0 <5.15.203, >=5.16.0 <6.1.168, >=6.2.0 <6.6.131, >=6.7.0 <6.12.80, >=6.13.0 <6.18.21, >=6.19.0 <6.19.11

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: fix double-free of smc_spd_priv when tee() duplicates splice pipe buffer

smc_rx_splice() allocates one smc_spd_priv per pipe_buffer and stores
the pointer in pipe_buffer.private.  The pipe_buf_operations for these
buffers used .get = generic_pipe_buf_get, which only increments the page
reference count when tee(2) duplicates a pipe buffer.  The smc_spd_priv
pointer itself was not handled, so after tee() both the original and the
cloned pipe_buffer share the same smc_spd_priv *.

When both pipes are subsequently released, smc_rx_pipe_buf_release() is
called twice against the same object:

  1st call: kfree(priv)  sock_put(sk)  smc_rx_update_cons()  [correct]
  2nd call: kfree(priv)  sock_put(sk)  smc_rx_update_cons()  [UAF]

KASAN reports a slab-use-after-free in smc_rx_pipe_buf_release(), which
then escalates to a NULL-pointer dereference and kernel panic via
smc_rx_update_consumer() when it chases the freed priv->smc pointer:

  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception

Beyond the memory-safety problem, duplicating an SMC splice buffer is
semantically questionable: smc_rx_update_cons() would advance the
consumer cursor twice for the same data, corrupting receive-window
accounting.  A refcount on smc_spd_priv could fix the double-free, but
the cursor-accounting issue would still need to be addressed separately.

The .get callback is invoked by both tee(2) and splice_pipe_to_pipe()
for partial transfers; both will now return -EFAULT.  Users who need
to duplicate SMC socket data must use a copy-based read path.
