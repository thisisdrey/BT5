# [C] CVE-2016-6830

## Summary
Severity: Critical
Advisory: CVE-2016-6830
CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2017-01-10
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2016-6830
Type: osv

## Details
The "process-execute" and "process-spawn" procedures in CHICKEN Scheme used fixed-size buffers for holding the arguments and environment variables to use in its execve() call. This would allow user-supplied argument/environment variable lists to trigger a buffer overrun. This affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and including 4.11 (it will be fixed in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet released).
