# Q2463: Vault async redeem flow: partial withdraw / reserve mismatch / burned-share fairness

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption while the manager approves only part of the pending shares before later approvals and make totalClaimableRedeemAssets or the per-controller counters diverge from the actual reserved USDC, breaking the rule that shares burned at approval should never let a controller withdraw more assets than the approval-time NAV allowed and leading to User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: alternating redeem() and withdraw() claims against the same claimable redemption
- Exploit idea: make totalClaimableRedeemAssets or the per-controller counters diverge from the actual reserved USDC
- Invariant to test: shares burned at approval should never let a controller withdraw more assets than the approval-time NAV allowed
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved redemptions become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Model a tight-liquidity approval followed by partial claims and assert no controller can extract more than the burned shares justified.
