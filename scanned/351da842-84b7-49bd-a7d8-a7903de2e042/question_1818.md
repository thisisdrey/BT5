# Q1818: Exchange offer lifecycle: address-book churn / misbound whitelist / all-or-nothing settlement

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance while the deadline is close enough that ordering and timestamp boundaries matter and make the mutual-registration checks bind the wrong effective buyer or seller at settlement time, breaking the rule that acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly and leading to Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance
- Exploit idea: make the mutual-registration checks bind the wrong effective buyer or seller at settlement time
- Invariant to test: acceptance should either deliver every listed NFT and the agreed cash or revert cleanly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
