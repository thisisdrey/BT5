# Q0477: Loans funding and disbursement state: lock cycle / epoch confusion / single funding

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a normal list-lock-unlock cycle around the same loan before funding or disbursement while status-like fields or off-chain expectations changed nearby but the economic balances still define the real state and make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions, breaking the rule that `fund` should only succeed once per loan and only for the current NFT owner of that same loan and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution between investor, borrower, and originator paths?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a normal list-lock-unlock cycle around the same loan before funding or disbursement
- Exploit idea: make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions
- Invariant to test: `fund` should only succeed once per loan and only for the current NFT owner of that same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution between investor, borrower, and originator paths
- Fast validation: Forge test ownership changes, lock cycles, and standing allowances around `fund`, then assert only the current NFT owner can move capital exactly once.
