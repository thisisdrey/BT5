# Q2566: accrue-debt-asset via collateral-remove: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the set of assets held, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result? `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result, so the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
