# Q0463: ubalance via transfer: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `transfer` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `transfer` with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, then read `ubalance` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
