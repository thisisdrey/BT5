# Q0539: Loans funding and disbursement state: role handoff / phase skip / no stale owner

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call while status-like fields or off-chain expectations changed nearby but the economic balances still define the real state and make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable, breaking the rule that a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch and leading to Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call
- Exploit idea: make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable
- Invariant to test: a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC
- Fast validation: Fuzz commitment-sized amounts and lifecycle orderings, then assert funding and disbursement preserve the exact same commitment ledger.
