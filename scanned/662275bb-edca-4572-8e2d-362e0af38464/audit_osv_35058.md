# [H] Command Injection in fsSize() on Windows

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2025-68154
Aliases: GHSA-wphj-fx3q-84ch
CVSS: 8.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Type: osv

## Details
systeminformation is a System and OS information library for node.js. In versions prior to 5.27.14, the `fsSize()` function in systeminformation is vulnerable to OS command injection on Windows systems. The optional `drive` parameter is directly concatenated into a PowerShell command without sanitization, allowing arbitrary command execution when user-controlled input reaches this function. The actual exploitability depends on how applications use this function. If an application does not pass user-controlled input to `fsSize()`, it is not vulnerable. Version 5.27.14 contains a patch.
