# Q0546: Loans funding and disbursement state: role handoff / wrong investor pull / exact commitment

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call while the NFT has been approved, listed, cancelled, or transferred shortly before the funding call and make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan, breaking the rule that the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan and leading to Unintended or unfair fund distribution between investor, borrower, and originator paths?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a loan whose investor ownership changes between creation and the attempted funding call
- Exploit idea: make `fund` pull from or account for the wrong investor identity for the same loan
- Invariant to test: the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund distribution between investor, borrower, and originator paths
- Fast validation: Fuzz commitment-sized amounts and lifecycle orderings, then assert funding and disbursement preserve the exact same commitment ledger.
