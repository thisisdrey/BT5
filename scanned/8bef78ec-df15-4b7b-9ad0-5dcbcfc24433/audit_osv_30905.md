# [H] io_uring: check if iowq is killed before queuing

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2024-56709
Ecosystem: Linux
CVSS: 7.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
Published: 2024-12-29
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2024-56709
Type: osv

## Affected
- Linux: `Kernel` — affected >=5.14.0 <6.1.122, >=6.2.0 <6.6.68, >=6.7.0 <6.12.7

## Details
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: check if iowq is killed before queuing

task work can be executed after the task has gone through io_uring
termination, whether it's the final task_work run or the fallback path.
In this case, task work will find ->io_wq being already killed and
null'ed, which is a problem if it then tries to forward the request to
io_queue_iowq(). Make io_queue_iowq() fail requests in this case.

Note that it also checks PF_KTHREAD, because the user can first close
a DEFER_TASKRUN ring and shortly after kill the task, in which case
->iowq check would race.
