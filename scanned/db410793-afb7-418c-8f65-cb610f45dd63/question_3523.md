# Q3523: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: erc20 route / safe confusion / finite allowance conservation

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with token, from, to, and amount across one allowed route and one nearby disallowed route while the route exists with a current positive allowance or a current NFT blanket approval and make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context, breaking the rule that finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less and leading to Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: token, from, to, and amount across one allowed route and one nearby disallowed route
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context
- Invariant to test: finite route allowances should decrease exactly by what was actually transferred and never more or less
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts
- Fast validation: Model repeated finite-allowance transfers and assert the stored allowance matches the exact total transferred.
