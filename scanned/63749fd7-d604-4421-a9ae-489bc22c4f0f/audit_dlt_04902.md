# Put options don't work like typical put options

## Summary

In a typical put option the option seller (bull) always keeps premium regardless of whether the option buyer (bear) exercises their order. In BullVBear the bear gets both the premium and the strike when they exercise the order. 

## Vulnerability Detail

        uint bearAssetAmount = order.premium + order.collateral;
        if (bearAssetAmount > 0) {
            // Transfer payment tokens to the Bear
            IERC20(order.asset).safeTransfer(bear, bearAssetAmount);
        }

When a bear exercises their put option they are transferred both the premium and collateral. This is an atypical setup for put options.

## Impact

Atypical option setup causes user confusion and unwanted risk for users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Options should be changed to mirror the typical put setup with the bull keeping the premium regardless of exercise
