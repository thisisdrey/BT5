# Q0618: Loans funding and disbursement state: batch neighbor / phase skip / exact commitment

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with one target loan plus a nearby loan in a different lifecycle phase that the attacker also controls while the NFT has been approved, listed, cancelled, or transferred shortly before the funding call and make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable, breaking the rule that the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: one target loan plus a nearby loan in a different lifecycle phase that the attacker also controls
- Exploit idea: make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable
- Invariant to test: the funded amount and disbursed amount should always map to the same remaining commitment for the same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and lifecycle guards around funding or disbursement
- Fast validation: Assert that any failed disbursement or replay attempt reverts without leaving priceable or withdrawable balances behind.
