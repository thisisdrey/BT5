## Details
There is a logical error in the _distributeFees() function, resulting in an unfair distribution of fees.
```solidity
function _distributeFees(PoolKey memory _poolKey) internal {
    // If the pool is not initialized, we prevent this from raising an exception and bricking hooks
    PoolId poolId = _poolKey.toId();
    PoolParams memory poolParams = _poolParams[poolId];
    if (!poolParams.initialized) {
        return;
    }
    // Get the amount of the native token available to donate
    // Ensure that the collection has sufficient fees available
    return;
}
// Reduce our available fees
_poolFees[poolId].amount0 = 0;
// Split the donation amount between beneficiary and LP
// Make our donation to the pool, with the beneficiary amount remaining in the
// contract ready to be claimed.
if (poolFee > 0) {
    // Determine whether the currency is flipped to determine which is the donation side
    (uint amount0, uint amount1) = poolParams.currencyFlipped ? (uint(0), poolFee) : (poolFee, uint(0));
    BalanceDelta delta = poolManager.donate(_poolKey, amount0, amount1, '');
    // Check the native delta amounts that we need to transfer from the contract
    if (delta.amount0() < 0) {
        _pushTokens(_poolKey.currency0, uint128(-delta.amount0()));
    }
    if (delta.amount1() < 0) {
        _pushTokens(_poolKey.currency1, uint128(-delta.amount1()));
    }
    emit PoolFeesDistributed(poolParams.collection, poolFee, 0);
}
// Check if we have beneficiary fees to distribute
if (beneficiaryFee != 0) {
    // If our beneficiary is a Flayer pool, then we make a direct call
    if (beneficiaryIsPool) {
        // As we don't want to make a transfer call, we just extrapolate
        // the required logic from the `depositFees` function.
        _poolFees[_poolKeys[beneficiary].toId()].amount0 += beneficiaryFee;
        emit PoolFeesReceived(beneficiary, beneficiaryFee, 0);
    }
    // Otherwise, we can just update the escrow allocation
    else {
        beneficiaryFees[beneficiary] += beneficiaryFee;
        emit BeneficiaryFeesReceived(beneficiary, beneficiaryFee);
    }
}
```
If beneficiaryIsPool = true, then BaseImplementation::beneficiary is the Flayer protocol’s NFT Collection. We can also confirm this from the setBeneficiary() function.
```solidity
function setBeneficiary(address _beneficiary, bool _isPool) public onlyOwner {
    beneficiary = _beneficiary;
    beneficiaryIsPool = _isPool;
    // If we are setting the beneficiary to be a Flayer pool, then we want to
    // run some additional logic to confirm that this is a valid pool by checking
    // if we can match it to a corresponding {CollectionToken}.
    if (_isPool && address(locker.collectionToken(_beneficiary)) == address(0)) {
        revert BeneficiaryIsNotPool();
    }
    emit BeneficiaryUpdated(_beneficiary, _isPool);
}
```
The function checks that the NFT collection must have the corresponding collectionToken.
```solidity
function feeSplit(uint _amount) public view returns (uint poolFee_, uint beneficiaryFee_) {
    // If our beneficiary royalty is zero, then we can exit early and avoid reverts
    if (beneficiary == address(0) || beneficiaryRoyalty == 0) {
        return (_amount, 0);
    }
    // Calculate the split of fees, prioritising benefit to the pool
    beneficiaryFee_ = _amount * beneficiaryRoyalty / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
    poolFee_ = _amount - beneficiaryFee_;
}
```
In the feeSplit() function, the fees are divided into two parts: poolFee (95%) and beneficiaryFee (5%). The poolFee goes to the LP Holders of the collectionToken for some NFT, while the beneficiaryFee goes to the LP Holders of the collectionToken for the Flayer protocol’s NFT.
The root cause of the issue is that when _distributeFees() is called for the collectionToken of the Flayer protocol’s NFT Collection (which we will refer to as the collectionToken of Flayer), _poolKeys[beneficiary].toId() and PoolId poolId = _poolKey.toId(); result in the same poolId. This leaves 5% of the fees undistributed, which is clearly wrong. It should distribute 100% of the fees to the current LP Holders.
According to the current logic in the code, when _distributeFees() is called for the collectionToken of the Flayer protocol’s NFT, it always leaves 5% of the fees unallocated.
If a user provides liquidity to the pool, 95% of the fees will be distributed to the original LP Holders. However, the new LP Holder, upon joining, will immediately gain a share of the remaining 5% of the fees. That's wrong.
The newly joined LP Holders receive an unfair portion of the fees, leading to a loss for the original LP Holders.

## Recommendation
```solidity
// Split the donation amount between beneficiary and LP
if(poolId==_poolKeys[beneficiary].toId()){
    beneficiaryFee = 0;
}
```
