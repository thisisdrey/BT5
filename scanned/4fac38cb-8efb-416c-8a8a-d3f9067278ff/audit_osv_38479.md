# [M] openCryptoki: Memory safety vulnerabilities in BER/DER decoders in asn1.c

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: CVE-2026-40253
Aliases: GHSA-c9cf-6vr4-wfxm
CVSS: 6.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H)
Published: 2026-04-16

Type: osv

## Details
openCryptoki is a PKCS#11 library and provides tooling for Linux and AIX. In versions 3.26.0 and below, the BER/DER decoding functions in the shared common library (asn1.c) accept a raw pointer but no buffer length parameter, and trust attacker-controlled BER length fields without validating them against actual buffer boundaries. All primitive decoders are affected: ber_decode_INTEGER, ber_decode_SEQUENCE, ber_decode_OCTET_STRING, ber_decode_BIT_STRING, and ber_decode_CHOICE. Additionally, ber_decode_INTEGER can produce integer underflows when the encoded length is zero. An attacker supplying a malformed BER-encoded cryptographic object through PKCS#11 operations such as C_CreateObject or C_UnwrapKey, token loading from disk, or remote backend communication can trigger out-of-bounds reads. This affects all token backends (Soft, ICA, CCA, TPM, EP11, ICSF) since the vulnerable code is in the shared common library. A patch is available thorugh commit ed378f463ef73364c89feb0fc923f4dc867332a3.
