# Q3734: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: nft route / expiry bypass / strict expiry

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances while the route is configured with an infinite ERC20 allowance and long validity and spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid, breaking the rule that expired allowances should never authorize any further ERC20 or ERC721 movement and leading to Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: collection, from, to, and tokenId across blanket NFT allowances
- Exploit idea: spend after expiry or across an expiry edge when the route should no longer be valid
- Invariant to test: expired allowances should never authorize any further ERC20 or ERC721 movement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unintended or unfair fund or NFT distribution across Safe accounts
- Fast validation: Forge test one delegate across several Safes and routes and assert each transfer consumes only the exact approved route.
