# Q3107: compression bomb on a compressible protocol field — version.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through `broadcast_tx_commit` / `send_tx` RPC carrying a SignedTransaction signed by an ordinary FullAccess key, a highly compressible payload sized to expand enormously on decompression, with trailing bytes appended after a valid encoding, and additionally with a non-minimal length prefix, reach `protocol_version` in `core/primitives-core/src/version.rs` and make decompression allocate or spend far more than the accounting expects, breaking the invariant that decompressed size is bounded before decompression proceeds, leading to High - Temporary freezing of network transactions (chunk/block production delayed 500%+ over recent average)?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives-core/src/version.rs` :: `protocol_version`
- Entrypoint: `broadcast_tx_commit` / `send_tx` RPC carrying a SignedTransaction signed by an ordinary FullAccess key
- Attacker controls: a highly compressible payload sized to expand enormously on decompression; with trailing bytes appended after a valid encoding; with a non-minimal length prefix
- Exploit idea: make decompression allocate or spend far more than the accounting expects
- Invariant to test: decompressed size is bounded before decompression proceeds
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of network transactions (chunk/block production delayed 500%+ over recent average)
- Fast validation: unit test decompressing a maximal-ratio payload with the limit enforced
