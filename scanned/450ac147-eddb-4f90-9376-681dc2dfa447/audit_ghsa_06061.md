### Patches

### How to update

For self-hosters using Docker, find [Docker’s official Ghost image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost) and follow the documentation on [updating a Docker-based Ghost instance](https://docs.ghost.org/install/docker#updating-ghost).

For self-hosters using Ghost-CLI, see the documentation for [updating Ghost to the latest version](https://docs.ghost.org/update).
