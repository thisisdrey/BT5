# [M] OpenClaw vulnerable to arbitrary file read via $include directive

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-56pc-6hvp-4gv4
CVE: CVE-2026-32061
CWE: CWE-22
Ecosystem: npm
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-03-03
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-56pc-6hvp-4gv4
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- npm: `openclaw` — affected >=0 <2026.2.17

## Details
## Vulnerability

Path traversal in config `$include` resolution allowed arbitrary local file reads outside the config directory boundary (CWE-22).

### Attack Vectors

1. If an attacker can modify OpenClaw config, they can set `$include` to absolute paths (for example `/etc/passwd`) and read files accessible to the OpenClaw process.
2. If an attacker can modify OpenClaw config, they can use traversal paths (for example `../../...`) to escape the config directory.
3. If an attacker can create symlinks inside the config directory, they can point includes to external files unless real-path checks are enforced.
4. Impact scope is bounded by the file permissions of the OpenClaw runtime user; this is not an unauthenticated remote-only vector by itself.

## Impact

A successful exploit can expose local secrets and credentials readable by the OpenClaw process user, including API keys and private config material.

## Affected Packages / Versions

- Package: `openclaw` (npm)
- Vulnerable versions: `<=2026.2.15`
- Patched versions: `>=2026.2.17`

## Fix Commit(s)

## Release Process Note

Patched version is pre-set to `2026.2.17`. Once npm release `2026.2.17` is available, this advisory is ready to publish.
