# [C] Use after free and out of bounds read in xmlrpc_decode()

## Summary
Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.8)
Program: Internet Bug Bounty
Weakness: Use After Free
Reporter: hanno
State: resolved

CVE: CVE-2019-9020
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/477896

## Details
Malformed input can lead to use after free and out of bounds memory errors.

This has been fixed with the latest updates of PHP (7.1.26/7.2.14/7.3.1).

(Note: I reported those as separate bugs to PHP, but they had the same underlying bug and were fixed by the same commit. The release notes only mention "out of bounds read", but this is misleading, as a use after free error is potentially more severe.)

## Impact

If the xmlrpc functionality of PHP is used to parse untrusted input from a public API point it can potentially be used to gain code execution.
