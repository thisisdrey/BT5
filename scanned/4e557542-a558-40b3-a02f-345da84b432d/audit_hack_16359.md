## Details
# Oracle fee might be stuck in oracle factory contract
## Summary
Oracle fee might be stuck in oracle factory contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
When OracleFactory#fund() is called, it will trigger market#claimFee(), which will transfer oracle fee back to the oracle factory contract.
The problem is that if incentive token is different from oracle fee token, there is no way for the owner to withdraw fee money.

Even when incentive and oracle fee are same token and can be withdrawn by OracleFactory#claim(), withdrawing will still be quite cumbersome. Oracle factory owner will have to register their own factory and either:
- Withdraw small amount (maxClaim limit) multiple times, paying more gas fee
or
- set maxClaim to total amount of token in contract and withdraw only one time. However, if any other factory calls claim(maxClaim) before the owner, funds will be lost.

## Impact
Token stuck in contract and/or potentially minor loss of funds for the owner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement withdraw function or transfer token directly from market to oracle factory's owner
