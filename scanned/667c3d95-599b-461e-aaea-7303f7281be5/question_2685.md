# Q2685: root_slot_view accepts input it should reject (vote_state_view.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `root_slot_view` in `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` with an empty or single-element set at the boundary of the accumulation, and have `root_slot_view` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`root_slot_view` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` -> `root_slot_view()` (around line 225)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: an empty or single-element set at the boundary of the accumulation
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `root_slot_view` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `root_slot_view` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `root_slot_view` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
