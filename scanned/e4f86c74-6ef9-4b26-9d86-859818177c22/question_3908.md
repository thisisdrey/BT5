# Q3908: total-assets via accrue: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the utilization the rate is interpolated at reach `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs, the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `accrue` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with the utilization the rate is interpolated at varied, and assert that the value `total-assets` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
