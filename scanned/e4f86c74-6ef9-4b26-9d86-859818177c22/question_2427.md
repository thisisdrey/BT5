# Q2427: normalize via liquidate: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
`normalize` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:576) divides by `(pow u10 decimals)` only AFTER multiplying amount by price, making the protocol's USD unit a whole dollar. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit, violating the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:576` -> `normalize`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `normalize` divides by `(pow u10 decimals)` only AFTER multiplying amount by price, making the protocol's USD unit a whole dollar. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `normalize` touches, run `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
