# [M] Division by 0 in `DenseCountSparseOutput`

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: BIT-tensorflow-2021-29554
Aliases: CVE-2021-29554, GHSA-qg48-85hg-mqc5, PYSEC-2021-191, PYSEC-2021-482, PYSEC-2021-680
Ecosystem: Bitnami
Published: 2024-03-06
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-tensorflow-2021-29554
Type: osv

## Affected
- Bitnami: `tensorflow` — affected >=2.4.0 <2.4.2

## Details
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.DenseCountSparseOutput`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/efff014f3b2d8ef6141da30c806faf141297eca1/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L123-L127) computes a divisor value from user data but does not check that the result is 0 before doing the division. Since `data` is given by the `values` argument, `num_batch_elements` is 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.
