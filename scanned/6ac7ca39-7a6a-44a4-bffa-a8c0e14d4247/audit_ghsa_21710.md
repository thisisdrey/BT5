# [M] On Windows, `git-sizer` might run a `git` executable within the repository being analyzed

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Advisory: GHSA-57q7-rxqq-7vgp
Ecosystem: Go
Published: 2022-02-15
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-57q7-rxqq-7vgp
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- Go: `github.com/github/git-sizer` — affected >=0 <1.4.0

## Details
### Impact
On Windows, if `git-sizer` is run against a non-bare repository, and that repository has an executable called `git.exe`, `git.bat`, etc., then that executable might be run by `git-sizer` rather than the system `git` executable. An attacker could try to use social engineering to get a victim to run `git-sizer` against a hostile repository and thereby get the victim to run arbitrary code.

On Linux or other Unix-derived platforms, a similar problem could occur if the user's `PATH` has the current directory before the path to the standard `git` executable, but this is would be a very unusual configuration that has been known for decades to lead to all kinds of security problems.

### Patches
Users should update to git-sizer v1.4.0

### Workarounds
If you are on Windows, then either
* Don't run `git-sizer` against a repository that might contain hostile code, or, if you must…
* Run `git-sizer` against a bare clone of the hostile repository, or, if that is not possible…
* Make sure that the hostile repository doesn't have an executable in its top-level directory before running `git-sizer`.

If you are on Linux or other Unix-based system, then (for myriad reasons!) don't add the current directory to your `PATH`.
