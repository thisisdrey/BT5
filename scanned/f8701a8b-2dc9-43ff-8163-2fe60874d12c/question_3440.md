# Q3440: accrue-user-debts via accrue: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the utilization the rate is interpolated at reach `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it folds accrual over the position's debt list only, the invariant that only the acting principal's own position is mutated breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `accrue` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: only the acting principal's own position is mutated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with the utilization the rate is interpolated at varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-debts` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
