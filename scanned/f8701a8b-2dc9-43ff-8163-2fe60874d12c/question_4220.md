# Q4220: oracle-price-legal via liquidate-redeem: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the borrower targeted varied, and assert that the value `oracle-price-legal` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
