# Q5690: DeployContract mid-batch with a later FunctionCall — universal_state_init.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a single transaction batching many actions against an attacker-owned receiver, DeployContract followed by FunctionCall in one action list, where the new code changes storage layout, when the receiver account already exists with balance and keys, and additionally when the receiver account does not yet exist, reach `data` in `core/primitives/src/universal_state_init.rs` and have the FunctionCall execute against a cached compiled artifact of the previous code, breaking the invariant that a FunctionCall always executes the code hash the account holds at that point in the batch, leading to Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork?

## Target
- File/function: `core/primitives/src/universal_state_init.rs` :: `data`
- Entrypoint: a single transaction batching many actions against an attacker-owned receiver
- Attacker controls: DeployContract followed by FunctionCall in one action list, where the new code changes storage layout; when the receiver account already exists with balance and keys; when the receiver account does not yet exist
- Exploit idea: have the FunctionCall execute against a cached compiled artifact of the previous code
- Invariant to test: a FunctionCall always executes the code hash the account holds at that point in the batch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Unintended permanent chain split requiring a hard fork
- Fast validation: runtime test asserting the executed code hash after an in-batch redeploy
