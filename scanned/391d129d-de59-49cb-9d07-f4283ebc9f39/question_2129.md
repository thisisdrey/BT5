# Q2129: calc-liq-factor via liquidate-redeem: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, drive `calc-liq-factor` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703) — which computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold — to convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction, breaking the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:703` -> `calc-liq-factor`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor` computes `(- ltv-curr ltv-liq-partial)` over `(- ltv-liq-full ltv-liq-partial)`, a subtraction that aborts below the partial threshold. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
