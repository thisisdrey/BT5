# Q3992: get-full-position via supply-collateral-add: convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) in a state where it convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction? Given that it returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and convert a rounding direction into a repeatable extraction.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `get-full-position` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
