# [M] EL-2026-06: RLPx protocol accepts excessive auth packets before disconnection

## Summary
Severity: Medium
Chain: Ethereum (execution layer)
Component: Nethermind
Source: https://notes.ethereum.org/gDWKW5RtSym02t2aGYkmSQ
Type: ef-disclosure

## Details
Nethermind client accept too many packets with rlpx protocol
Attack scenario *
More detailed description of the attack/bug scenario and unexpected/buggy behaviour
When making the initial handshake with a node the first step is :

1. initiator connects to recipient and sends its auth message

the initiator can send many auth message before getting disconnected by the recipient (nethermind client) .

i was able to send up to 180k message before nethermind closing the connection.

In comparaison to others execution clients :

-Reth accepts 20-30 messages before closing the connection.
-Geth between 50 and 100
-Besu 2OO-500
-Erigon 80-120
Impact *
 Describe the effect this may have in a production setting
Setting limits on the number of packets sent reduces the risk of DoS. 

Accepting so many could pose a problem and make Nethermind more vulnerable.

I tried monitoring with docker a Nethermind client and Geth client to see how they react to this, here is the results :

By sending the packets (up to 180k with nethermind) i'm able to add 60-70MB to the network in one connection before nethermind close the connection. In comparaison with Geth (50-100 packets before closing the connection) this add only 0.1 MB to the network data. 

I have also observed that the CPU %, which runs between 10 and 20 % in normal time, rises to 105% when I send packets to nethermind. In comparaison with Geth the CPU% does not seem to change when i'm sending the packets.

For the memory usage i don't see anything wrong .
Components *
Point to the files, functions, and/or specific line numbers where the bug occurs
the bug occurs in the first step of the rlpx initial handshake . (https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/rlpx.md#initial-handshake) 
Reproduction *
If used any sort of tools/simulations to find the bug, describe in detail how to reproduce the buggy behaviour.
I use a modified version of Geth devp2p binaries available here :
