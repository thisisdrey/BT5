# Q0092: principal-ratio-reduction via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-underlying` reach `principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `min-underlying` varied, and assert that the value `principal-ratio-reduction` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
