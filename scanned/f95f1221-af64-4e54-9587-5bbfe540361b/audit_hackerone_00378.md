# [C] GitLab CI runner can read and poison cache of all other projects

## Summary
Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.0)
Program: GitLab
Weakness: Path Traversal
Reporter: jobert
State: resolved

CVE: CVE-2017-0918

## Details
The GitLab CI runner allows users to cache files and directories in between runs. These files are stored in a ZIP file and uploaded to a shared cache instance. In my testing, the files were uploaded to `runners-cache-4-internal.gitlab.com` and `runners-cache-3-internal.gitlab.com`, even for dedicated runners. It seems odd that dedicated runners use the same shared cache, but perhaps that was an intentional design decision. It could also be a vulnerability. I tried reaching the cache servers from a Docker instance itself, but wasn't able to (I tried from a reverse shell spawned from a Docker instance). There are multiple vulnerabilities (same root cause though) that can be chained to successfully poison the CI runner cache of another project.

**Reading the cache of other projects**
Create a new project with a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in it. The file should contain the following contents. By default, when a cache file is downloaded, it'll download the cache from http://runners-cache-4-internal.gitlab.com:444/runner/project/5024150/cache.

**.gitlab-ci.yml**
```
a:
  script:
  - ls -lashR
  cache:
    key: ../1/cache
    policy: pull
    paths:
      - .
```

To read the cache, the attacker needs to know two things: a project ID (auto incremental) and a cache key. By default, the project ID will be prepended to download the cache. But because it's an HTTP request and there's no additional checks on the `key` input, a path traversal vulnerability can be exploited to move up a directory and select the cache from a different project. In this case, when it downloads the cache, it'll request http://runners-cache-4-internal.gitlab.com:444/runner/gitlab/project/1/cache instead of the project ID of the build.
