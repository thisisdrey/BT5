# Q1648: zip via call-ststx-ratio: make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and make an aggregate and its per-item breakdown disagree.
- Invariant to test: a value cached within a block still describes the state it was derived from
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
