# Q0552: calc-index-next via call-ststx-ratio: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that no position row exists that the position mask does not represent breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: no position row exists that the position mask does not represent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `calc-index-next` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
