# Q1855: Exchange offer lifecycle: address-book churn / bundle inconsistency / full unlock on cancel

## Question
Can an unprivileged seller or designated buyer using only normal exchange entrypoints enter through `LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer` with buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance while one side is a vault or later counterparty that relies on precise lock cleanup and delivery semantics and make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert, breaking the rule that cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue and leading to Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LoansExchange.sol / createOffer -> acceptOffer -> cancelOffer
- Entrypoint: LoansExchange.createOffer/acceptOffer/cancelOffer
- Attacker controls: buyer and seller each changing only their own address-book registrations around acceptance
- Exploit idea: make bundle settlement deliver or account for some loans differently from the rest without a full revert
- Invariant to test: cancelling an offer should restore the seller's control over every listed loan without residue
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-user cashflow or ownership reassignment during exchange settlement
- Fast validation: Check that acceptance and cancellation leave storage and lock state perfectly aligned for every listed loan.
