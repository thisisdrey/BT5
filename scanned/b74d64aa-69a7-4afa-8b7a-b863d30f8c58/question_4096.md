# Q4096: tip191 - `try_into().ok()?` swallowing a malformed key or signature (4)

## Question
Given the victim account has no entry in `self.accounts`, so `has_public_key` falls back to implicit-key derivation, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `execute_intents` relayed through a public relayer key (function-call access key restricted to `execute_intents`), reach a branch of `SignedTip191Payload` in `contracts/defuse/core/src/payload/tip191.rs` where a malformed key, point-at-infinity, or non-canonical scalar is discarded with `.ok()?` in a way that changes which arm decides the result rather than rejecting outright, breaking the invariant ``SignedTip191Payload` returns `Some(pk)` only when a cryptographically valid signature by `pk` over the exact payload exists` and leading to direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/core/src/payload/tip191.rs](contracts/defuse/core/src/payload/tip191.rs) - `SignedTip191Payload` (cross-check `verify` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `execute_intents` relayed through a public relayer key (function-call access key restricted to `execute_intents`)
- Attacker controls: the payload contents; the relayer only forwards them
- Exploit idea: Supply values that fail conversion in one arm so control falls through to a weaker arm or to a default that still returns a public key. Set-up: the victim account has no entry in `self.accounts`, so `has_public_key` falls back to implicit-key derivation.
- Invariant to test: `SignedTip191Payload` returns `Some(pk)` only when a cryptographically valid signature by `pk` over the exact payload exists
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds: custodied balances moved without the owner's authorisation
- Fast validation: Fuzz `SignedTip191Payload` with malformed keys/signatures; assert it never returns `Some` for an invalid pair.
