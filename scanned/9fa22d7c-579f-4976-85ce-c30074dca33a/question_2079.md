# Q2079: promise - postponed burn events decouple from the actual state change

## Question
Given the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through `ft_withdraw` / `nft_withdraw` / `mt_withdraw` called directly by an account with `auth_by_predecessor_id` enabled, exploit that `promise_result_checked_json` in `crates/near/utils/src/promise.rs` defers `mt_burn` emission to the end of the transaction while balances change immediately, so an off-chain indexer or a same-receipt consumer acts on a state it cannot yet observe, breaking the invariant `the burn events emitted by a receipt == the balance reductions that receipt committed` and leading to temporary freezing of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: [crates/near/utils/src/promise.rs](crates/near/utils/src/promise.rs) - `promise_result_checked_json` (cross-check `promise_result_checked_json_with_args` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: `ft_withdraw` / `nft_withdraw` / `mt_withdraw` called directly by an account with `auth_by_predecessor_id` enabled
- Attacker controls: `token`, `receiver_id`, `amount`, `memo`, `msg`, `storage_deposit` and `min_gas`
- Exploit idea: `self.runtime.postponed_burns` batches burns; probe whether a failing later step leaves emitted-but-unapplied or applied-but-unemitted events. Set-up: the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value.
- Invariant to test: the burn events emitted by a receipt == the balance reductions that receipt committed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of user funds
- Fast validation: Abort a batch after a postponed burn is queued; assert no burn event is emitted.
