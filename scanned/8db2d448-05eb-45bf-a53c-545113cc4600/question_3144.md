# Q3144: Address-book role bit isolation: canonical adjacency / book bleed / exact whitelist

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with self-book actions performed near canonical-book admin changes but without any privileged access while a later `create` flow will read borrower, investor, or servicer bits from the chosen address book and make self-book updates affect canonical-book semantics or another address owner's semantics, breaking the rule that loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: self-book actions performed near canonical-book admin changes but without any privileged access
- Exploit idea: make self-book updates affect canonical-book semantics or another address owner's semantics
- Invariant to test: loan creation and exchange counterpart checks should require the exact intended role bit in the exact intended book
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules
- Fast validation: Forge test role-bit combinations and assert each downstream check accepts only the exact role and exact book intended.
