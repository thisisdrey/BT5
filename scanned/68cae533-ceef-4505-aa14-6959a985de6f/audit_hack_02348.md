# [H] \[H07\] The quorum requirement can be trivially bypassed with sybil accounts

## Summary
Severity: High
Source: https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/blob/6f3b31562b9d4c43cef91af0a011986a2580fba2/eth-contracts/contracts/Governance.sol#L366
Type: audit-issue

## Details
While the final vote on a proposal is determined via a token-weighted vote, [the quorum check](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/blob/6f3b31562b9d4c43cef91af0a011986a2580fba2/eth-contracts/contracts/Governance.sol#L366) in the `evaluateProposalOutcome` function can be trivially bypassed by splitting one’s tokens over multiple accounts and voting with each of the accounts. Each of these sybil votes [increases the proposals\[\_proposalId\].numVotes variable](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/blob/6f3b31562b9d4c43cef91af0a011986a2580fba2/eth-contracts/contracts/Governance.sol#L281). This means anyone can make the quorum check pass.

Consider measuring quorum size by the percentage of existing tokens that have voted, rather than the number of unique accounts that have voted.

_**Update:** Fixed in [pull request #574](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/pull/574). However, note that the [setVotingQuorumPercent function](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/pull/574/files#diff-cdd717eae25ddcfc7ccd2b9bd6be68c1R466) is not validating that the value set is between 0 and 100._
