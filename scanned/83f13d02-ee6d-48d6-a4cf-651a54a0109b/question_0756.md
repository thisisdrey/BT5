# Q0756: resolve-dia via call-ststx-ratio: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block reach `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) in a state where it satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? Given that it derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, the invariant that a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: a vault's underlying plus outstanding debt covers all shares and all supplier claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `resolve-dia` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
