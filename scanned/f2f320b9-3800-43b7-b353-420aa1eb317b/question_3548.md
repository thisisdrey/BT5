# Q3548: close_account: migrated or delegated authority path accepts the wrong signer [an-account-that-just-exited] [partial-transition]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `close_account` from `close_account` with an account that just exited a flashloan or receivership state so a migrated, delegated, or PDA-owned account accepts the wrong authority, violating `closing an account must never strand value or release a container that still secures live positions` and causing `High: permanent lock or hidden exposure with real financial effect`? Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/instructions/marginfi_account/close.rs` / `close_account`
- Entrypoint: `close_account`
- Attacker controls: an account that just exited a flashloan or receivership state
- Exploit idea: Check all alternate authorization paths for mismatched signer identity, stale authority fields, or incorrect PDA derivation assumptions. Focus specifically on whether a partially completed state transition leaves enough residual state for the attacker to finish it incorrectly.
- Invariant to test: closing an account must never strand value or release a container that still secures live positions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent lock or hidden exposure with real financial effect
- Fast validation: Model authority transfer/migration and verify that only the intended signer path can mutate or close the account at each phase. Force failure after the first state mutation and assert the attacker cannot finalize, replay, or redirect the transition.
