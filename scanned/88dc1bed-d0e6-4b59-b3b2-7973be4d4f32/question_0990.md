# Q0990: Investor withdrawal routing: duplicate ids / stuck route / single claim per payable

## Question
Can an unprivileged investor, unlocker, buyer, or seller using only normal withdrawal and transfer flows enter through `Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)` with duplicate, reordered, or adversarially mixed loan ids in the batch while the first loan in the batch is locked and fixes the recipient as the active unlocker and make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary, breaking the rule that each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs and leading to Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / investorWithdraw
- Entrypoint: Loans.investorWithdraw(uint64[],uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: duplicate, reordered, or adversarially mixed loan ids in the batch
- Exploit idea: make a valid payable balance become unreachable because lock or ownership state changed at the wrong boundary
- Invariant to test: each principal or interest payable balance should be withdrawable at most once across all ownership and lock epochs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loans NFT cashflow rights becoming stuck or routed to the wrong party
- Fast validation: Model sale-offer settlement or cancellation around `investorWithdraw` and assert no stale unlocker or stale owner can claim old payables.
