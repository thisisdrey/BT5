# Q917: initialize: freeze semantics can be bypassed through an alternate user flow [remaining-accounts-that-contain-multiple] [role-reuse]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker bypass the intended freeze semantics by invoking `initialize_account` with remaining accounts that contain multiple plausible group or authority contexts so `initialize` still changes a blocked account, violating `new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context` and causing `High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze`? Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.

## Target
- File/function: `programs/marginfi/src/state/marginfi_account.rs` / `initialize`
- Entrypoint: `initialize_account`
- Attacker controls: remaining accounts that contain multiple plausible group or authority contexts
- Exploit idea: Audit alternate user flows that eventually touch the same balances but may not call the common frozen-account guard. Focus specifically on stale authority, migrated-account, or delegated-account reuse after one valid-looking transition.
- Invariant to test: new account initialization must bind authority, group, and flags canonically and never let a stranger create a controllable victim context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: unauthorized state change or durable victim fund freeze
- Fast validation: Freeze the account, exercise alternate paths, and assert every value-moving route rejects before any state mutation occurs. Model one valid transition first, then retry with the attacker as the next caller and assert authority cannot be reused.
