# Q3812: TrustedSpender route and allowance scoping: finite allowance / safe confusion / no cross-route bleed

## Question
Can an unprivileged delegate of its own Safe, without any rights on a victim Safe enter through `TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)` with a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls while there are several recipient routes for the same Safe and token or collection and make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context, breaking the rule that a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/TrustedSpender.sol / executeTransfer, executeNFTTransfer, setAllowance, setNFTAllowance
- Entrypoint: TrustedSpender.executeTransfer(...) and executeNFTTransfer(...)
- Attacker controls: a finite allowance that the attacker tries to consume through repeated or interleaved calls
- Exploit idea: make a delegate of one Safe spend from another Safe or another route context
- Invariant to test: a valid route should never authorize value movement along a neighboring route that only looks similar
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and allowance scoping
- Fast validation: Check that neighboring recipients, collections, or tokens cannot be reached through a superficially similar approved route.
