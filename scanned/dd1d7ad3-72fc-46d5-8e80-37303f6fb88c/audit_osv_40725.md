# [H] jadx: XAPK archive entries with absolute paths can plant drop-in plugins and achieve code execution on the next jadx run

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: CVE-2026-54684
Aliases: GHSA-gpvc-ccw7-744v
CVSS: 7.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Type: osv

## Details
jadx is a Dex to Java decompiler. From 1.5.2 to 1.5.5, a malicious .xapk file can cause jadx to write attacker-controlled archive entry contents outside the intended XAPK plugin temporary unpack directory because XApkLoader resolves each entry name directly with tmpDir.resolve(fileName) after a CWD-based ZIP security check. When jadx is launched from a directory that is an ancestor of the config directory, the arbitrary write can plant a JAR in plugins/dropins, and the next jadx run loads the JAR with URLClassLoader and ServiceLoader, executing attacker-controlled plugin code. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.6.
