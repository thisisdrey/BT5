# [H] xiaomusic contains an unauthenticated path traversal vulnerability

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-5j8p-5rrj-8wjg
CVE: CVE-2026-10108
CWE: CWE-22
Ecosystem: PyPI
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-05-29
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5j8p-5rrj-8wjg
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- PyPI: `xiaomusic` — affected >=0 <0.5.8

## Details
xiaomusic v0.5.7 contains an unauthenticated path traversal vulnerability in the GET /music/{file_path:path} endpoint that allows unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files outside the intended music directory by exploiting an incomplete path prefix check. Attackers can request files from sibling directories whose names share the music_path prefix by crafting traversal sequences, bypassing the path restriction due to the missing trailing separator in the comparison logic to retrieve arbitrary files from the server.
