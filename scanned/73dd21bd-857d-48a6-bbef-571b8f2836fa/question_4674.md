# Q4674: get-notional-evaluation via supply-collateral-add: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `get-notional-evaluation` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
