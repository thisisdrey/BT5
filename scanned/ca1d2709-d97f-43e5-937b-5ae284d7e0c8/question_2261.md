# Q2261: Vault async redeem flow: split owner-controller / dust strand / proportional reserve

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder or operator using only normal redeem and withdraw entrypoints enter through `PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest` with owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses while the manager approves only part of the pending shares before later approvals and strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be withdrawn or cancelled, breaking the rule that claimableRedeemShares[controller] and claimableRedeemAssets[controller] should decay proportionally to each claim and leading to Accounting issue in the vault leading to underreserved claimable redemptions?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestRedeem -> approveRedemption -> redeem/withdraw -> cancelRedeemRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestRedeem/redeem/withdraw/cancelRedeemRequest
- Attacker controls: owner, controller, and receiver split across attacker-controlled addresses
- Exploit idea: strand non-zero approved assets or shares that can no longer be withdrawn or cancelled
- Invariant to test: claimableRedeemShares[controller] and claimableRedeemAssets[controller] should decay proportionally to each claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in the vault leading to underreserved claimable redemptions
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated redeem()/withdraw() calls against partially approved redemptions and assert reserve counters stay exact.
