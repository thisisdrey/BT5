# Q0376: Loans funding and disbursement state: standing allowance / double-fund path / same-loan accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing while a vault, buyer, or downstream counterparty could rely on the resulting balances after funding or disbursement and make commitment or `alreadyFunded` checks observe an inconsistent ledger state that allows replayed funding or funding after the economic state advanced, breaking the rule that funding or disbursing one loan should never create withdrawable or priceable balances attributable to another loan or investor and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing
- Exploit idea: make commitment or `alreadyFunded` checks observe an inconsistent ledger state that allows replayed funding or funding after the economic state advanced
- Invariant to test: funding or disbursing one loan should never create withdrawable or priceable balances attributable to another loan or investor
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing
- Fast validation: Assert that any failed disbursement or replay attempt reverts without leaving priceable or withdrawable balances behind.
