# Q0908: validate_update_parent_slot accepts input it should reject (blockstore.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `validate_update_parent_slot` in `ledger/src/blockstore.rs` with a boundary value exactly on the accept/reject edge of the predicate, and have `validate_update_parent_slot` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`validate_update_parent_slot` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `ledger/src/blockstore.rs` -> `validate_update_parent_slot()` (around line 573)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a boundary value exactly on the accept/reject edge of the predicate
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `validate_update_parent_slot` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `validate_update_parent_slot` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `validate_update_parent_slot` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
