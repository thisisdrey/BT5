# [H] Infinite loop when iterating over zip archive entry names from zipfile.Path

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: BIT-libpython-2024-8088
Aliases: BIT-python-2024-8088, BIT-python-min-2024-8088, CVE-2024-8088, PSF-2024-10
Ecosystem: Bitnami
Published: 2025-08-11
Source: https://osv.dev/vulnerability/BIT-libpython-2024-8088
Type: osv

## Affected
- Bitnami: `libpython` — affected >=3.12.0 <3.12.6

## Details
There is a HIGH severity vulnerability affecting the CPython "zipfile"
module affecting "zipfile.Path". Note that the more common API "zipfile.ZipFile" class is unaffected.





When iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methods
of "zipfile.Path" like "namelist()", "iterdir()", etc)
the process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously crafted
zip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extracting
the contents of the zip archive. Programs that are not handling
user-controlled zip archives are not affected.
