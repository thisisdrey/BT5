# Q0331: Loans funding and disbursement state: standing allowance / phase skip / no stale owner

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing while the loan is still `Created` with positive borrower principal receivable and zero investor principal payable and make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable, breaking the rule that a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch and leading to Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a standing ERC20 approval from the current investor plus attacker-controlled NFT transfer timing
- Exploit idea: make disbursement succeed after an unprivileged sequence that should have left the loan unfundable or undisbursable
- Invariant to test: a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or unauthorized pull of investor USDC
- Fast validation: Forge test ownership changes, lock cycles, and standing allowances around `fund`, then assert only the current NFT owner can move capital exactly once.
