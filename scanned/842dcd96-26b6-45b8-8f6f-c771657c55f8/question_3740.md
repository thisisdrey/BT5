# Q3740: insert via liquidate: reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never c

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) in a state where it reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated? Given that it rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id, the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `liquidate` and reach a state the guard immediately upstream of it never contemplated.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted varied, and assert that the value `insert` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
