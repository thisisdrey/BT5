# Q1946: insert via collateral-remove: make a health check read a different position than the one

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist? `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id, so the invariant that collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make a health check read a different position than the one that will exist.
- Invariant to test: collateral seized equals debt repaid scaled by the penalty, and only above the liquidation LTV
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `insert` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
