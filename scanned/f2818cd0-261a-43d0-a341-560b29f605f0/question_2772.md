# Q2772: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via supply-collateral-add: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg reach `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) in a state where it make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount? Given that it reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt, the invariant that a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price reflects a gated feed whose inputs the caller cannot move in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
