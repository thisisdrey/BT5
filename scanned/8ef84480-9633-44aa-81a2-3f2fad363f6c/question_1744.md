# Q1744: num_secp256k1_signatures accepts input it should reject (runtime_transaction.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `num_secp256k1_signatures` in `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction.rs` with a boundary value exactly on the accept/reject edge of the predicate, and have `num_secp256k1_signatures` accept input that fails the property it is supposed to prove, so that the invariant "`num_secp256k1_signatures` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction.rs` -> `num_secp256k1_signatures()` (around line 93)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a boundary value exactly on the accept/reject edge of the predicate
- Exploit idea: Construct input that `num_secp256k1_signatures` accepts although it fails the property it is supposed to prove (signature, proof, derivation, ownership).
- Invariant to test: `num_secp256k1_signatures` accepts exactly the valid set: no forged input passes and no valid input fails.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test `num_secp256k1_signatures` against a reference implementation over random valid and mutated-invalid inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can manipulate scheduling, account locks, or PoH recording so a recorded entry does not match the transactions actually executed, producing an invalid block honest nodes reject.
