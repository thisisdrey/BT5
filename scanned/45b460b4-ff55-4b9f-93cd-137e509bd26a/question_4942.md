# Q4942: mod - event log size aborts settlement (2)

## Question
Given the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value, can an unprivileged attacker, entering through a `FtWithdraw` / `MtWithdraw` / `NftWithdraw` / `NativeWithdraw` / `StorageDeposit` / `AuthCall` intent inside `execute_intents`, make `MT_RESOLVE_DEPOSIT_BASE_GAS` in `contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/mod.rs` build a `memo`, `token_ids` or event payload large enough that `check_refund()` or the log limit aborts after balances were already changed, breaking the invariant `a receipt that changes balances always succeeds in emitting its events, or changes no balances at all` and leading to permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)?

## Target
- File/function: [contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/mod.rs](contracts/defuse/src/contract/tokens/mod.rs) - `MT_RESOLVE_DEPOSIT_BASE_GAS` (cross-check `resolve_deposit_internal` in the same file)
- Entrypoint: a `FtWithdraw` / `MtWithdraw` / `NftWithdraw` / `NativeWithdraw` / `StorageDeposit` / `AuthCall` intent inside `execute_intents`
- Attacker controls: every field of the withdrawal intent, including `msg`, `min_gas`, `state_init` and `attached_deposit`
- Exploit idea: Memos and token id strings are attacker-controlled and are concatenated into `MtTransferEvent` / `MtBurnEvent`; the code notes refund logs can grow too long. Set-up: the receiver is a contract the attacker deployed that returns a crafted JSON value.
- Invariant to test: a receipt that changes balances always succeeds in emitting its events, or changes no balances at all
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of user funds (unrecoverable without a privileged action)
- Fast validation: Grow memo/token-id lengths until emission fails; assert balances are unchanged on failure.
