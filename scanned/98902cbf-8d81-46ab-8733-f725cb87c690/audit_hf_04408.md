## Details
When a validator invokes `Settlement.cairo`’s `receive_cross_chain_callback()`, they will pass the `cross_chain_msg_status` as an input and base on that the msg status should be set on the source chain. Means, if the `cross_chain_msg_status` is given as `SUCCESS` then the msg status on the source chain will be set as `CrossChainTxStatus::SETTLED` and if it is not `SUCCESS` then it should simply set the status to `CrossChainTxStatus::FAILED` but in the cairo implementation, the `cross_chain_msg_status` is completely ignored:

```solidity
fn receive_cross_chain_callback(ref self: ContractState, cross_chain_msg_id: felt252, from_chain: felt252, to_chain: felt252,
from_handler: u256, to_handler: ContractAddress, cross_chain_msg_status: u8) -> bool{
    assert(to_handler == get_contract_address(),'error to_handler');

    assert(self.settlement_address.read() == get_caller_address(), 'not settlement');

    assert(self.support_handler.read((from_chain, from_handler)) && 
            self.support_handler.read((to_chain, contract_address_to_u256(to_handler))), 'not support handler');

    let erc20 = IERC20MintDispatcher{contract_address: self.token_address.read()};
    if self.mode.read() == SettlementMode::MintBurn{
        erc20.burn_from(get_contract_address(), self.created_tx.read(cross_chain_msg_id).amount);
    }
    let created_tx = self.created_tx.read(cross_chain_msg_id);
    ///@audit-issue M cross_chain_msg_status not checked like in the solidity instance, this will always set tx_status as settled and return true and never Failed!
    self.created_tx.write(cross_chain_msg_id, CreatedCrossChainTx{
        tx_id: created_tx.tx_id,
        from_chain: created_tx.from_chain,
        to_chain: created_tx.to_chain,
        from:created_tx.from,
        to:created_tx.to,
        from_token: created_tx.from_token,
        to_token: created_tx.to_token,
        amount: created_tx.amount,
        tx_status: CrossChainTxStatus::SETTLED
    });

    return true;
}
```

The `tx_status` is directly set as `SETTLED`, which means it will be always get marked as `SETTLED` even when the Msg gets failed on the destination chain.

Also, as it doesn’t check the `cross_chain_msg_status`, this will always burn the tokens (when the MODE is MintBurn), which is not the case when we look at the solidity instance

```solidity
if self.mode.read() == SettlementMode::MintBurn{
    erc20.burn_from(get_contract_address(), self.created_tx.read(cross_chain_msg_id).amount);
}
```

## Proof of Concept
In the solidity instance both the status is checked and tokens only get burned when the status gets marked as SETTLED:

```solidity
if (status == CrossChainMsgStatus.Success) {
    if (mode == SettlementMode.MintBurn) {
        _erc20_burn(address(this), create_cross_txs[txid].amount);
    }

    create_cross_txs[txid].status = CrossChainTxStatus.Settled;
}

if (status == CrossChainMsgStatus.Failed) {
    create_cross_txs[txid].status = CrossChainTxStatus.Failed;
}
```

## Recommendation
Make sure to check the given status and mark the `tx_status` base on that.

The submission details how the callback leg of a `MintBurn` mode bridge will always burn the tokens regardless of whether the transaction actually succeeded on the destination chain.

This indicates a high-risk issue within the codebase that would lead to fund loss if the destination chain’s execution fails.
