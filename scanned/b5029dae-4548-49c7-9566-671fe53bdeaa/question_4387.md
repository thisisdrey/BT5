# Q4387: convert-to-shares-preview via deposit: make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacke

## Question
`convert-to-shares-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308) returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing `amount`, use that to make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount, violating the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308` -> `convert-to-shares-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Reach it through `deposit` and make two code sites that must agree disagree by an attacker-chosen amount.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `deposit` with `amount`, then read `convert-to-shares-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
