# Q0463: Loans funding and disbursement state: lock cycle / epoch confusion / no stale owner

## Question
Can an unprivileged current investor, borrower, or ordinary caller trying to exploit funding or disbursement boundaries enter through `Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)` with a normal list-lock-unlock cycle around the same loan before funding or disbursement while the loan is still `Created` with positive borrower principal receivable and zero investor principal payable and make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions, breaking the rule that a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch and leading to Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / fund -> disburse
- Entrypoint: Loans.fund(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32) and Loans.disburse(...)
- Attacker controls: a normal list-lock-unlock cycle around the same loan before funding or disbursement
- Exploit idea: make one ownership or lock epoch affect the next epoch so capital or rights move under stale assumptions
- Invariant to test: a stale owner, stale approval, or stale lock epoch should never authorize capital movement in a newer ownership epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans that later affects withdrawals or vault pricing
- Fast validation: Model a create-transfer-fund-disburse sequence and assert stale ownership or stale lock state never authorizes a later epoch.
