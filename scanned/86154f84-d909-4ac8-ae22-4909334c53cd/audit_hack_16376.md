## Details
# The convertToShares and convertToAssets functions are vulnerable to manipulation of the total shares and assets values.
## Summary
The convertToShares and convertToAssets functions assume the total shares and assets can't be manipulated. But an attacker could potentially manipulate checkpoints to change these values. The calculations should check for valid, immutable values.
## Vulnerability Detail
The convertToShares and convertToAssets functions are vulnerable to manipulation of the total shares and assets values.

The key issue is that these functions rely on calling totalShares() and totalAssets() to get the current total shares and assets. However, an attacker could manipulate these values by manipulating the checkpoint data.

Specifically, an attacker could:

1. Deposit assets into the vault to increase totalAssets()
2. Withdraw all their shares to reduce totalShares()
3. Call convertToShares() to convert a small amount of assets into a large amount of shares. This works because totalAssets is high and totalShares is low.
4. Withdraw the newly minted shares to drain assets from the vault
## Impact
Assets are drained

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
convertToShares and convertToAssets should rely on immutable values that can't be manipulated, like:
- The initial total supply of shares
- The total deposits into the vault
- The total withdrawals / redemptions from the vault
