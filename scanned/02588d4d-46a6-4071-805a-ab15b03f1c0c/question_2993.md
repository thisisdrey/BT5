# Q2993: Address-book role bit isolation: book churn / bit confusion / role isolation

## Question
Can an unprivileged address-book owner controlling only its own registrations enter through `LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)` with rapid register/unregister cycles for the same grantee across different roles while the canonical `address(this)` book and a self-managed book both contain related addresses and make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role, breaking the rule that each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role and leading to Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/misc/LoansAuth.sol / registerAddress, unregisterAddress, isRegisteredForRole
- Entrypoint: LoansAuth.registerAddress(Roles,address) and unregisterAddress(Roles,address)
- Attacker controls: rapid register/unregister cycles for the same grantee across different roles
- Exploit idea: make one role bit satisfy another role check or leave stale authorization after unregistering the wrong role
- Invariant to test: each role bit should authorize only its own role and never another role
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of intended permissions and whitelisting rules
- Fast validation: Model one self-managed book plus the canonical book and assert they can never substitute for each other.
