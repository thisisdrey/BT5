# [H] Transformers save_pretrained path traversal allows arbitrary file writes through chat template names

## Summary
Severity: High
Advisory: GHSA-xrqw-3rrv-vx5w
CVE: CVE-2026-9856
CWE: CWE-22
Ecosystem: PyPI
CVSS: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L (CVSS_V3)
Published: 2026-08-02
Source: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xrqw-3rrv-vx5w
Type: github-advisory

## Affected
- PyPI: `transformers` — affected >=0 <5.10.0

## Details
A vulnerability in huggingface/transformers versions < 5.10.0 allows an attacker to perform arbitrary file writes via path traversal. The issue resides in the `save_pretrained()` methods of `PreTrainedTokenizerBase` and `ProcessorMixin`, where keys from the `chat_template` dictionary are used directly as filenames without proper validation. An attacker can exploit this by publishing a malicious Hugging Face Hub repository with a crafted `tokenizer_config.json` file. When a victim downloads and saves the tokenizer or processor, the attacker-controlled keys can escape the intended save directory, enabling arbitrary file writes with attacker-controlled content. This vulnerability affects multiple processors inheriting from `ProcessorMixin`, including Idefics, Florence, Gemma, Phi, and Qwen-VL.
