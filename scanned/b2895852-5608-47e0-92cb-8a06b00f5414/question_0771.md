# Q0771: Loans payment clearing and borrower effects: charged-off pay / clearing mismatch / cash-to-clearing consistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged borrower or payer acting only through normal `pay` calls enter through `Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)` with payments into a loan that is `ChargedOff` but still accepts borrower payments while the loan is `Active` with non-zero principal or interest receivables and make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes, breaking the rule that the cash held after `pay` should always have a consistent representation in borrower payment clearing for that same loan and leading to Accounting issue in Loans ledger or Vault?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Loans.sol / pay
- Entrypoint: Loans.pay(uint64,int128,uint48,bytes32)
- Attacker controls: payments into a loan that is `ChargedOff` but still accepts borrower payments
- Exploit idea: make borrower payment clearing and actual cash diverge from what downstream entitlement or pricing logic assumes
- Invariant to test: the cash held after `pay` should always have a consistent representation in borrower payment clearing for that same loan
- Expected Immunefi impact: Accounting issue in Loans ledger or Vault
- Fast validation: Forge test repeated borrower payments before any waterfall and assert cash, clearing, and later valuation remain consistent.
