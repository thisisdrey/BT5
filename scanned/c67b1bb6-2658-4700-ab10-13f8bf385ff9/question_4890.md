# Q4890: linear-interpolate via liquidate-multi: satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), can an unprivileged attacker make `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit? `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, so the invariant that every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and satisfy a bound with a value the bound was never designed to admit.
- Invariant to test: every asset a position holds enters the health evaluation exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `linear-interpolate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
