# Q4854: deterministic account id derivation collision — receipt_manager.rs

## Question
Can an unprivileged mainnet account, entering through a `DeterministicStateInit` / `UniversalStateInit` action creating an attacker-controlled account, two different DeterministicStateInit payloads chosen so their derived account ids collide, when combined with a DeleteAccount later in the same action list, and additionally when the receiver account already exists with balance and keys, reach `append_action_add_key_with_function_call` in `runtime/runtime/src/receipt_manager.rs` and have a second attacker init overwrite or take over state under an id already derived by someone else, breaking the invariant that derived deterministic account ids are collision-resistant and bind the full init payload, leading to High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/runtime/src/receipt_manager.rs` :: `append_action_add_key_with_function_call`
- Entrypoint: a `DeterministicStateInit` / `UniversalStateInit` action creating an attacker-controlled account
- Attacker controls: two different DeterministicStateInit payloads chosen so their derived account ids collide; when combined with a DeleteAccount later in the same action list; when the receiver account already exists with balance and keys
- Exploit idea: have a second attacker init overwrite or take over state under an id already derived by someone else
- Invariant to test: derived deterministic account ids are collision-resistant and bind the full init payload
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Direct theft of user funds via access-key / meta-transaction / wallet-contract authorization bypass
- Fast validation: unit test over the derivation function asserting distinct payloads yield distinct ids
