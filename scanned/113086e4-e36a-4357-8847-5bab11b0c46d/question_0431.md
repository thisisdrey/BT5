# Q0431: calc-cumulative-debt via collateral-remove-redeem: compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorr

## Question
`calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) multiplies scaled principal by an index. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, use that to compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result, violating the invariant that conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and compose two individually correct mechanisms into an incorrect result.
- Invariant to test: conversions never round in the user's favour in either direction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
