# Q2193: Vault async deposit flow: repeat approvals / ratio drift / proportional decay

## Question
Can a whitelisted shareholder controlling owner, controller, receiver, and optionally an operator enter through `PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest` with a controller that is approved in several partial chunks across time while the manager approves only part of the pending assets before later approvals and make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims, breaking the rule that claimableDepositAssets[controller] and claimableDepositShares[controller] should decay proportionally to the actual claim and leading to User funds stuck because approved deposits become partially unclaimable?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/PortfolioVault.sol / requestDeposit -> approveDeposit -> deposit/mint -> cancelDepositRequest
- Entrypoint: PortfolioVault.requestDeposit/deposit/mint/cancelDepositRequest
- Attacker controls: a controller that is approved in several partial chunks across time
- Exploit idea: make claimableDepositAssets and claimableDepositShares decay out of proportion during repeated claims
- Invariant to test: claimableDepositAssets[controller] and claimableDepositShares[controller] should decay proportionally to the actual claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: User funds stuck because approved deposits become partially unclaimable
- Fast validation: Simulate partial approvals across time and assert claimable assets and shares can always be fully exhausted without dust-locking value.
